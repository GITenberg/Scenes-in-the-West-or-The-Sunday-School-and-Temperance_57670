<p>The author of this volume has brought together
a few incidents in <i>real</i> life to illustrate
the power of godliness in the individual, and
the blessings of the Sunday-school, the influence
of the prayer-meeting and the cause of temperance
in the church and in the community.</p>

<p>That the God of all our mercies may bless
this little book to the reader, is the prayer of

<div class="verse">&#8220;The melancholy days had come,</div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp; The saddest of the year.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">ALL nature seemed to be resting in a quiet
dreamy slumber. The bee had well
nigh laid up its winter store, and many of the
birds were preparing to leave for more genial
climes in the sunny south. All these were but
the harbingers of the cold storms that were
lingering behind the snow-covered mountains
of the north. Indian summer, the season of
romance, like the life of a humble Christian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">&nbsp; [14]</a></span>
leaves its loveliest scenes to its departing
hours. It was in the midst of these balmy
days that you might have seen a traveler with
a worn satchel in one hand and a staff in the
other coming up a narrow lane leading to the
home of a prosperous Western settler. He
walked slowly, for he had left behind him
many weary miles; his countenance, though
calm, was pale and languid; yet his eye
seemed to bespeak the hope that here he
might find the much-needed rest.</p>

<p>Two men were standing beside the gate at
the end of the lane when the stranger came
up. The one was a kindly disposed person
with but little force of character, and deficient
in moral courage, whom we shall know as
Mr. Kerr. The other, whose name was Steele,
was the owner of the premises.</p>

<p>He was a large man, selfish and resolute,
a conceited formalist, bigoted, exceedingly
headstrong, and greatly prejudiced against
all Christian zeal.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>No sooner did Mr. Steele notice the approach
of the stranger than he turned to Mr.
Kerr and exclaimed: &#8220;There, I&#8217;ll bet you,
comes that Sunday-school, temperance loafer
I&#8217;ve heard so much of lately. I reckon he
expects to get in here; but I tell you, sir, my
&#8216;shanty&#8217; don&#8217;t hold the like of him, while I&#8217;m
boss here, &#8216;that&#8217;s said!&#8217;&#8221; This was uttered
with emphatic bitterness. To this passionate
outburst Mr. Kerr ventured a little palliation
by the remark that he had heard that in the
other settlement the people seemed to like
the missionary very well.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> would have nothing to do with his
nonsense, would you?&#8221; retorted Mr. Steele
with a look of scorn.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; feebly and insincerely muttered Mr.
Kerr, &#8220;we have got along so far without it,
and I guess we can get along without it a little
further.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my ticket,&#8221; sharply added Mr.
Steele.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>By this time the stranger had reached the
gate. A calm, pleasant smile lit up his pale
countenance; and he accosted them with,</p>

<p>&#8220;Good evening, friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good evening, sir,&#8221; responded Mr. Kerr.</p>

<p>&#8220;How d&#8217;ye do, sir,&#8221; thundered out Mr.
Steele.</p>

<p>&#8220;This has been a very pleasant day,&#8221; ventured
the traveler.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; curtly replied Mr. Steele.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very tired,&#8221; continued the stranger;
&#8220;could I stay with you to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are the fellow who goes about lecturing
on temperance, and getting up Sunday-schools,
aint you?&#8221; sarcastically rejoined
Mr. Steele, his face reddening.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is my calling,&#8221; meekly added the
man of God.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you don&#8217;t stay all night in my
house; I don&#8217;t harbor fellows who are too
lazy to work,&#8221; sneeringly answered the excited
Mr. Steele.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>&#8220;But I am very tired, and my head aches
badly; I&#8217;ll pay you well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cant help it. The sooner you make
tracks the better,&#8221; retorted the unfeeling man.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid it will storm to-night,&#8221; continued
the missionary, pointing to a dark
cloud which was looming up in the west.</p>

<p>&#8220;You might have stayed at home and
minded your own business, instead of minding
other people&#8217;s, and kept out of this
trouble,&#8221; replied Mr. Steele, with a look so
severe that the poor wanderer lost all hope
of any comfort or favor from this seemingly
inhospitable dwelling; so he inquired how
far it was to the next house.</p>

<p>&#8220;That depends entirely upon which way
you go,&#8221; mockingly answered the hard-hearted
man, with a wink to Mr. Kerr, and
a conceited smile at the unfeeling wit he had
displayed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect to continue my labors westward,&#8221;
gently added the missionary.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>His soul was grieved at the hardness of
this man&#8217;s heart, and for a moment he felt
like looking upon his persecutor with anger.
But he remembered that even his Lord and
Master was mocked and derided; that &#8220;when
He was reviled, He reviled not again; but
as a lamb before his shearers is dumb, so He
opened not his mouth.&#8221; And the humble
follower of the Man of Sorrows in silence
offered up the prayer, &#8220;Father, forgive them,
they know not what they do.&#8221;</p>

<p>The door of common humanity being
closed against him, he made up his mind to
continue his journey, let the dangers and
privations be what they might. An angel
seemed to whisper, &#8220;I will lead thee in the
way in which thou shalt go;&#8221; so he took
courage.</p>

<p>Being thirsty, he ventured to ask for a
drink of water.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can go to the spring,&#8221; was the abrupt
answer, and the cruel man turned upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
his heel, and in company with Mr. Kerr passed
on to the barn, leaving the suffering one
standing by the gate alone.</p>

<p>But George, a lad of about ten years, and
Mary, a little flower of seven summers, had
looked on and listened with the curiosity
common to children. Their hearts were filled
with pity toward the poor man; and, when
even a drink of water was denied him, the
inherent kindness, implanted in all our natures,
was instantly awakened.</p>

<p>In a moment, as the missionary turned the
corner of the yard, the two children met him
each with &#8220;a cup of cold water.&#8221; &#8220;Here is
good fresh water, please drink,&#8221; said the little
ones. His heart was melted at this unexpected
exhibition of kindness; and invoking
a blessing upon the dear children, he raised
the cup to his lips and was refreshed. He
then opened his satchel, and gave each child
a picture card and Sunday-school paper, also
cards for the men, together with a neat little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
tract for their mother. Bidding them good-by,
he with a sigh resumed his lonely journey.</p>

<p>The children, happy in having done a kindness,
hurried to their mother, and were soon
showing and admiring the papers and cards;
she, mother-like, very naturally shared their
pleasure, but thought of the stranger with a
pang of regret, for she feared that he would
take the road leading into an unsettled region,
infested with wild beasts and roving Indians.
After admiring the pictures, she told the
children all she knew of the Sunday-school,
for which these beautiful things were made,
at the same time hoping that her husband&#8217;s
opposition to them might be removed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish there was Sunday-school here,&#8221;
said George.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t there be Sunday-school here,
mother?&#8221; exclaimed both at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid not,&#8221; said their mother, sorrowfully,
knowing the hostility of many of
the neighbors toward anything of the kind.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>&#8220;Why not, mother?&#8221; innocently asked
the children.</p>

<p>This was one of those questions children
often ask, and which it is so hard to answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she replied, evasively, adding,
&#8220;go give your father and Mr. Kerr their
cards. They are at the barn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hurrying out, their noisy delight soon arrested
the attention of the men.</p>

<p>&#8220;What in the world is up now?&#8221; wondered
their father.</p>

<p>&#8220;See here, father, see here!&#8221; exclaimed
the children, holding out the cards.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who gave you these?&#8221; said he, reaching
out his hand for the gifts, and suspecting the
source.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man at the gate; we gave him a
drink, and he gave us these (showing their
cards) and a little book for mother, and this
one for you and that one for Mr. Kerr.&#8221;</p>

<p>Looking for a moment at the engraving, he
read, &#8220;For I was an hungered, and ye gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me
drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me
in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly the terrible reproof, associated
with these words, awakened the man&#8217;s slumbering
conscience. Writhing under its force
he tried to construe the innocent gift into an
insult; then flinging it to the ground he
stamped his foot upon it.</p>

<p>At this exhibition of anger all the joy of
the children vanished.</p>

<p>Mary began to cry, and George wondered
what there was about the card to offend his
father.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Mr. Kerr had read his
card. The words were, &#8220;And <i>these</i> shall go
away into everlasting punishment, but the
righteous into life eternal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you got?&#8221; sneeringly asked
Mr. Steele, of his companion. Mr. Kerr read
the text with some emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what I expected! he thought to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
us a cut,&#8221; said the angry man, at the same
time adding many abusive words.</p>

<p>Mr. Kerr tried to assent to the remarks,
but the words upon the card had touched his
heart; and he felt like hating himself for
having yielded, against his convictions, to the
unreasonableness of his neighbor toward an
unoffending stranger. Putting the card in
his pocket, he was compelled to be an unwilling
listener to the tirade of a would-be Christian
(for Mr. Steele was a member of church)
against prayer-meetings, temperance societies
and Sunday-schools.</p>

<p>As soon as practicable, Mr. Kerr left for
home; his conscience still at work, accusing
him of cowardice, and partaking of another&#8217;s
sin. &#8220;And these shall go away into everlasting
punishment,&#8221; like a poisoned arrow was festering
in his heart, until his guilty imagination conceived
that the card contained his eternal doom.</p>

<p>Meeting his wife at the door of his house,
he handed her the fatal card.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, the kind stranger gave you this!&#8221; she
exclaimed with animation. &#8220;He was here this
afternoon, and gave each of us one of the same
kind, and left one for you. And then he prayed
with us. I wish he would settle here and get
up a Sunday-school, of which he talked so
much. I believe he is one of the best of men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish so too;&#8221; involuntarily broke from
the full heart of the stricken man; &#8220;I believe
he is a good man. He came to Mr. Steele&#8217;s a
few hours ago, but was turned off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you bring him home with
you?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I know I ought to have done so;
but I was afraid of Mr. Steele, who you know
hates all such people.&#8221; To avoid any more
questions on the subject, he asked to see
what the man had left for him. The card was
soon handed him, and he read: &#8220;Fear not
them which kill the body, but are not able to
kill the soul; but rather fear Him who is able
to destroy both soul and body in Hell.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>This was another arrow from the quiver of
the Almighty. His wife soon detected the
change that had come over him, and with
becoming solicitude endeavored to find out
the cause; but in this her efforts were evaded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was afraid of Mr. Steele,&#8221; thought he,
&#8220;who would not even dare to kill my body&mdash;whilst
I did not fear Him who is able to destroy
my soul.&#8221; Leaving him in his sorrow,
we will return to Mr. Steele.</p>

<p>The children, mortified and discouraged,
had left the barn, and gone to their mother
for consolation in their disappointment. This
was always afforded them; for never was a
mother more kind to her little ones, and yet
more decided in her endeavors to train them
in the right way.</p>

<p>Mr. Steele, being conscious of having done
wrong, tried to rid himself of his unpleasant
feelings, by bustling about, doing first this,
then that, for relief. It was late before he
entered the house, and lest he should be suspected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
of regretting what he had done, he
confronted his wife with, &#8220;I wonder what
kind of trash that loafer left here with you
and the children to-day? I guess he wants
to set up an agency here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are in the bureau drawer, there,&#8221;
said his wife, &#8220;shall I get them for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t want to see any more of the
trash;&#8221; and, going into another room, he
sat down to read a political speech. But it
failed to interest him. The coming darkness,
the looming up of heavy clouds in the distance,
the stranger out in the pathless wilds,
the abused privilege of doing good to&mdash;perhaps,
after all&mdash;one of the followers of the
Redeemer; the text on the card with its indirect
reproof, were thoughts which crowded
themselves upon his mind. For a moment
he wished that he had given the stranger
shelter; but prejudice had too long held sway
to be thus easily set aside. He had taken a
stand, and he would maintain it, let the consequences
be what they would.</p>

<small><i>MISFORTUNES.</i></small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">OUR traveler, after leaving Mr. Steele&#8217;s,
unfortunately took a road leading from
the inhabited portion of country. Night was
approaching, and the last sounds of human
habitations had long since ceased to greet his
ear; he still walked on, however, hoping that
some dwelling would come into view.</p>

<p>The sun had set behind the great mountain
of storm clouds in the west, and twilight
was drawing a curtain of darkness around.
The clouds rose higher and higher; the
heavens began to be overspread with long
masses of floating vapor, and the distant
gleam of lightning could now be distinctly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
seen. He now encountered a steep hill in
his march; his limbs could scarcely bear his
body along, but he knew that he must go on.
There were but few trees on the hill, and
their absence enabled him to see his way
more clearly in ascending, but the valley beyond
seemed shrouded in midnight darkness.</p>

<p>These wild regions were infested with
wolves and other ravenous beasts, and our
hero being unarmed, his life became hourly
more endangered. After struggling along
under accumulating difficulties, in utter loneliness
and discouragement he sat down on a
log to rest. It was to him an hour of trial;
and his patience almost failed him. But the
remembrance of God&#8217;s promise, &#8220;Behold, I
am with thee and will keep thee,&#8221; cheered
him. A clap of thunder warned him of the
approach of the storm, and aroused his enfeebled
energies to their task. But where
should he go? The darkness, if possible,
had increased; not a ray of light remained,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
excepting when the electric fluid for a moment
lit up the heavens with its lurid blaze
only to leave it still darker. An effort to
secure shelter must be made <i>at once</i>.</p>

<p>As he was anxiously hurrying on among
the weeds and fallen timber, a huge rattlesnake
that had coiled itself under some rubbish
suddenly sounded its &#8220;death-rattle.&#8221;
Finding that danger was threatening in the
heavens above, and lurking on the earth beneath,
he was on the point of sitting down
and awaiting his fate, when, suddenly, a flash
of lightning revealed an opening between
the tall trees, and the hope that there might
be some human habitation not far distant
caused him to again renew his efforts.</p>

<p>Moving cautiously forward, he succeeded
in crossing a stream of water; a short distance
beyond was an old, broken-down fence.
The glimpse which the lightning gave him of
this, the work of man, sent a thrill of joy to
his desponding heart.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>He anxiously watched for the electric
lamp to reveal the place of habitation. Now
and then a large drop of rain fell, and presently
a fearful blaze of lightning illuminated
the whole heavens, followed by a clap of
thunder that seemed to shake the earth to its
very foundation! The rain was now descending
upon the distant hill. Aroused to
a full sense of his danger, he commended his
soul to God, expecting to be crushed beneath
the falling timber, which could plainly be
heard above the roar of the elements.</p>

<p>As we all shrink from imminent danger, he
instinctively looked around for some protection.
Near by, in a clump of trees, he espied,
when it again lightened, something like a
roof. What a thrill of joy entered his heart!
Groping his way forward, he found a little hut
with door wide open as if to welcome him;
he needed no invitation, but rushed in, for the
storm was bursting upon him.</p>

<p>All within was dark and silent save a rustling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
in one corner and the flitting of a bat
overhead. The chilly dampness which pervaded
the room, and the musty smell that
came up from the floor, made the first impression
far from agreeable. The roof leaked
and the windows were gone. In one corner
he found a dry spot; here he nestled down,
awaiting the fury of the descending storm.</p>

<p>The elements were now raging with irresistible
power. The very earth seemed to
tremble under the contending forces that were
hurling destruction all around. Part of the
shattered roof came down, the trees were
torn up by the roots and the cabin was
almost lifted from its foundation.</p>

<p>Happily the winds hurled the rain against
the corner in which he had taken refuge,
and the logs, chinking and daubing that remained,
arrested the water, so that the place
which he occupied was comparatively dry,
whilst all the rest of the inside was deluged
with the dashing rain.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>Musing for a time upon his lonely condition
and his prospects for the future, he fell
asleep, and did not awake until it was quite
day. He arose, and kneeling down in that
deserted cabin, he brought all his sorrows
before God, and asked in great humility for
His guidance and protection.</p>

<p>The storm had passed, and the sun rose
in a serene and cloudless sky. After his communion
with God, he came out of his retreat
to view his surroundings.</p>

<p>The ground was literally covered with
pools of standing water, fallen timber and
fragments of vegetation. The cabin in which
he had slept had been long since deserted,
and the place looked mournfully desolate,
wild and forsaken.</p>

<p>As the lowlands were now full of standing
water, and the creek so high that to return
by the way he came was impossible, he took
up his satchel and staff, and proceeded westward
in search of a settlement.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>After wandering on for several hours he
came to a large swamp covered with reeds, tall
grass and spaces of open water; in some
places the covering was a beautiful carpet of
green moss, upon which one could stand, but
the least movement would shake the frail moss
bed for rods around; under this treacherous
cover there appeared to be a great depth of
quicksand and water. A path made by wild
animals along the margin of the swamp somewhat
relieved the irksomeness of passing
through it.</p>

<p>As he was traveling on he discovered the
footprints of a bear which had been turning
over some old logs in search of worms and
insects. An encounter with Bruin was something
for which he was wholly unprepared.
Sitting down to consider which course he had
better pursue, his attention was attracted by
a noise among the bushes behind him. He had
already passed the monster and might have
escaped unnoticed had he not sat down!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>The bear, seeing him, came out of the bushes
toward him. As our hero did not show any
signs of retreat the bear stopped and sat upon
his haunches, ready for a fight. The worn-out
missionary did not feel like accepting the
challenge, but was rather inclined to a purely
defensive policy. The bear remained stationary
for some time, waiting, no doubt, for a
demonstration of the purposes and ability of
the stranger. They eyed each other until that
indescribable superiority implanted in the eye
of man made the huge beast quail, and he
sullenly retreated into the thicket.</p>

<p>The way being now clear our traveler again
started on. The marsh was at length passed, but
another difficulty now presented itself in the
shape of an abrupt bluff; too much fatigued
to ascend it, he changed his course by its base,
still, however, designing to go westward. A
beautiful spring that gushed out from among
the rocks at the side of the hill invited him to
rest. Whilst laving his sore, feverish feet in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
its cool waters, he noticed the movements of
a little squirrel as it jumped from tree to tree,
gathering nuts for the coming winter. Here
he learned a lesson which would enable him
to appease his hunger.</p>

<p>Having eaten his frugal meal, and being
somewhat refreshed, his step was lighter. Another
stream impeded his progress, so he
again changed his course, following its windings
among the valleys and hills. Throughout
his whole course he had as yet seen no indications
of the presence of man.</p>

<p>The sun was again setting, and as the shades
of night increased and no dwelling appeared
he began to look about for some place of shelter.
As he was hastily ascending a ridge, a
pack of wolves commenced their discordant
yelps and howlings right in his front. Turning
around he wended his way up a ravine, walking
as fast as possible. Another pack of
wolves then set up a howl to his left; this
seemed to enrage the others, so that their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
hideous noise could not but chill the heart of
the defenseless wanderer.</p>

<p>To climb a tree and rest among its branches
for the night, was his first thought. A spreading
beech, with branches almost reaching
the ground, offered its accommodations.
After choosing his position in the tree, and
fixing himself, as he supposed, for the night,
he very soon found his limbs cramped and
his hold unsafe. Becoming satisfied that to
remain where he was would be risking his
life, he immediately descended. The darkness,
when off the tree, seemed much more
dense; and being now within reach of the
wolves, made him almost regret having left
it. &#8220;Oh, that I never had been called to this
sacrifice,&#8221; involuntarily burst from him. A
voice whispered: &#8220;The foxes have holes and
the birds of the air have nests, but the <i>Son
of Man</i> hath not where to lay His head.&#8221;
These words were not without effect, for
they led him to say, &#8220;if the Lord of Lords<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
suffered thus before me, why should I murmer
at my lot?&#8221; and he again &#8220;thanked God and
took courage.&#8221;</p>

<p>At length he succeeded in finding a hollow
tree which answered his purpose. Feeling that
he was in God&#8217;s hands, it was not long until
&#8220;tired nature&#8217;s sweet restorer&#8221; came to his
relief.</p>

<p>It is well that God conceals from us the
rod with which He intends to chasten us;
were it not so, our prospective trials would
seem greater than we could bear. The trials
encountered by His servant in this peculiar
case, were but the beginning of those in store
for him.</p>

<p>Having changed his course so often, he
lost all idea of the points of the compass.
The consequence was that he spent two days
and a night longer wandering in this wilderness.
At the expiration of that time he
found himself at the very old hut in which
he had spent the first night; which proved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
to him that he had been traveling in a circle.
Under the circumstances, he was very glad
to again avail himself of the protection thus
afforded.</p>

<small><i>RELIEF OBTAINED.</i></small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE night having passed, in the morning
the missionary felt satisfied that he could
not find his way back to the settlement which
he had left. For a time he tried to find the
old road by which he had come; but failing in
this, he directed his steps eastward. His
bewilderment having entirely left him, his
heart was joyous and his step light. Although
the people of the settlement to which he was
returning, were comparatively strangers to
him, he felt assured that many of them were
Christians more than in name, and others who
did not bear that name were kind-hearted and
charitable. Here was a work for him to do.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>The day was rapidly advancing; and the
elastic step of the morning had slackened to
a laborious effort to reach his destination.</p>

<p>Hark! What sound is that? The tinkling
of a bell! He now knew that he was
nearing the settlement. Pushing on, he saw
to his right several openings, and beyond
smoke curling up. He at length reached
the gate leading into the yard in front of a
farm-house. Everything had a neat and
comfortable appearance. That he might
here obtain relief, was now his ardent desire.</p>

<p>A dog that lay before the door, observing
the stranger at the gate, offered a decided
resistance to his entrance. The attention of
Mr. Brown, the farmer, was thus attracted,
and coming out of the house to see what was
the matter, he was struck with the forlorn
appearance of the stranger; and with feelings
of pity invited him in. The kind look and
cordial welcome touched the missionary&#8217;s
heart, and it was with difficulty that he kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
back the tears. Taking up his satchel, Mr.
Brown led the way into the house, and introduced
him as &#8220;a suffering stranger.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a few remarks respecting his present
situation, he commenced to relate what had
befallen him during the past few days. The
whole family gathered round to hear his pitiful
story; and all were greatly moved by the
recital of his sufferings.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must now lie down and rest,&#8221; kindly
insisted Mrs. Brown. &#8220;I have a comfortable
bed prepared for you in the adjoining room.
Henry, my boy, will you show the way?&#8221;</p>

<p>Henry was a lad about ten years old. A
look at his open, honest face at once prepossessed
you in his favor. He immediately did
what his mother desired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; said little blue-eyed Eliza, as
soon as the stranger had disappeared, &#8220;who
is this sick man, and what has he got in his
satchel there in the corner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, my dear child,&#8221; replied her mother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
&#8220;you should never ask two questions at once.
Answering your last question first, I do not
know what is in the satchel, nor should my
little girl be curious about that which does
not concern her. As to the man, he is the
missionary who traveled through here last
week, trying to get up a Sunday-school in our
neighborhood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A Sunday-school, mother! School on
Sunday! Why he must be a wicked man
to keep school on Sunday! I don&#8217;t want
to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her mother never having been in a Sunday-school
herself, scarcely knew how to explain
to her daughter the difference between
it and an ordinary day school. So she simply
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not a school like ours down at the
&#8216;Cross Roads,&#8217; but one in which we read the
Bible, and sing and pray, and are taught to
love the Saviour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, mother!&#8221; exclaimed the child, &#8220;then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
I would like to go. Do tell the man to have
one in our school-house. Will you mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, child, I will ask him if he gets well
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope he will get well soon,&#8221; said Eliza,
and bounded off to tell Henry the news. He
saw her coming, and as her manner showed
that she was greatly pleased, he called out in
one breath,</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you got? Who gave it to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have nothing,&#8221; she replied; &#8220;nobody
gave me anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes there did,&#8221; said Henry.</p>

<p>&#8220;No there didn&#8217;t,&#8221; curtly answered Eliza.</p>

<p>&#8220;What tickles you so then,&#8221; rejoined Henry
in a milder tone.</p>

<p>By this time Eliza&#8217;s ardor was quite dampened
by Henry&#8217;s manner, so she merely replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell you to-morrow,&#8221; and then left
him.</p>

<p>But Henry did not feel like waiting. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
sooner was she gone than he again sought
her, more anxious than ever to know what had
so excited her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;if you won&#8217;t be
so cross to me next time,&#8221; evidently feeling
that she had the advantage of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t cross. I&#8217;ll always be good and
nice,&#8221; said Henry, glad to come to terms, for
he felt very curious.</p>

<p>Eliza then sat down and told him all that
her mother had said about the Sunday-school,
occasionally adding an exclamation of her
own to make it seem more important.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.<br />

<small><i>AN APPOINTMENT.</i></small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">MRS. Brown, knowing that the missionary
had been deprived of the proper kind of
food for such a long time, thought it best that
he should now take it in small quantities and
at short intervals, and for this reason desired
her husband to rouse him, that he might again
partake of refreshment. It was now night,
and, after a season of devotion, all retired.</p>

<p>The sun had again risen. Hearts had
wakened; some to joy and hope, others to
sorrow and despair. The missionary had
rested well. Although he still looked pale, he
had in a great measure recovered from his fatigue.
The hospitality of this most excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
family, to whom Providence had directed
his steps, was shared with feelings of the deepest
gratitude.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown and his wife were earnest, devoted
Christians, possessing liberal views, and
were ever ready for any movement that could
show any reasonable prospect of doing good.
They never condemned what had not been
faithfully tried, unless forbidden by the Word
of God. Although they had never heard a
temperance lecture, and, as to a Sunday-school,
it was something respecting which their knowledge
was very indistinct; yet, when these
subjects were laid before them by the missionary,
and their great importance shown,
both were ready to try the experiment.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will make an appointment for you at
the school-house as soon as you will be able
to fill it,&#8221; said Mr. Brown, &#8220;and then you
can explain the whole matter to the people,
and we will try what we can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am ready, with God&#8217;s help, to commence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the work to-morrow,&#8221; said the missionary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to-morrow,&#8221; replied Mr. Brown; &#8220;you
must not disregard your health when duty
does not demand the sacrifice. As this matter
has not been much agitated here, and no
appointment is out, a few days rest until your
strength is sufficient to carry on the work
when commenced, will not be a neglect of
duty. As the young people have singing-school
in our school-house to-morrow after
noon, we will send and have an appointment
given out for you on Tuesday evening. We
will also have the announcement made at the
other school-house; then the people will have
a little time to think and talk the matter over,
and have their curiosity aroused, and we will
have a good turn-out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As you seem to understand matters so
well, I will leave all to you,&#8221; said the missionary.</p>

<p>Under the kind care of Mrs. Brown, our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
traveler improved rapidly, and his wonted
cheerfulness was gradually returning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know what is in that bundle
there in the corner?&#8221; inquired Eliza of her
brother Henry, in a loud whisper, and pointing
toward the stranger&#8217;s satchel.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess the stranger has his &#8216;things&#8217; in
it,&#8221; answered Henry, looking in the same
direction.</p>

<p>The missionary, hearing their conversation,
and wishing to gratify their curiosity as well
as please them, asked them to bring the
satchel to him.</p>

<p>After showing them a book full of pretty
pictures and a Sunday-school paper, he allowed
them to look at a great many beautiful
cards, upon which were printed hymns and
prayers. He explained the use of these
things, and gave each of them a card and
paper. To show &#8220;mother&#8221; what they had
received was of course the next thing to be
done, and they had almost forgotten to thank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the missionary in their hurry and glee. The
mother was almost as much pleased as the
children, especially with the papers. After
admiring them again, the children asked her
to lay them away that they might not become
soiled.</p>

<p>Sunday-school scholar, do you prize your
cards and papers as these children did? Or
do you carelessly soil and lose them&mdash;or perhaps
tear them up without reading them?</p>

<p>If you have thus indifferently treated them,
think of these little children, and, like them,
place your Sunday-school gifts among your
precious treasures. When you are grown to
manhood and womanhood, and called upon
to battle with life, you may look upon these
mementoes of childhood and youth with sad
but sweet recollections.</p>

<p>The next day being Sunday, after the morning
duties were finished, this family, with the
missionary, enjoyed a season of devotion and
Christian fellowship. As they, in the fear of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
God, intended to &#8220;move upon the enemy&#8217;s
works&#8221; on Tuesday night, it would be profitable
for the leader to know how the enemy
was entrenched, and what forces had been
employed against him; how these operated
and what their success.</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of people have you here in the
West?&#8221; inquired the missionary with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; replied Mr. Brown, &#8220;we have
what the geographer terms &#8216;a mixed population.&#8217;
Or, as old Peter Miller would say,
&#8216;good, bad and indifferent.&#8217; It is a great mistake
in eastern men to suppose that the western
pioneer is an ignoramus. You will find
some of the sharpest, best educated and most
energetic men of this continent here in the
West. A great many have the &#8216;bump of go-aheadativeness,&#8217;
as Fowler would say, &#8216;largely
developed&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Method or system is not so much looked
upon as &#8216;will it go?&#8217; &#8216;will it pay?&#8217; &#8216;how
long will it take?&#8217; The masses are what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
some term &#8216;fast men.&#8217; Money must be
made at once! Fortunes acquired in a day!
Circuitous approaches are inadmissible.
&#8216;Straight through and go ahead&#8217; is the cry.
&#8216;Young America&#8217; here is impatient of delay;
and if one way does not at once succeed,
another is tried; and if speedy results are not
seen, a new location or a change of business
is contemplated. Hence, &#8216;fogyism&#8217; is generally
discarded, and which ever way they
move they tend toward the extreme. This
restless spirit is the very secret of their being
here. Ambitious, brave and independent
minds seek their development in situations
where they can &#8216;make a country,&#8217; create
cities, establish commerce, and lay the foundation
for learning, art and science.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, indeed, Mr. Brown, you have given
me a very graphic description of the characteristics
of the western people, and it almost
makes me afraid to risk my abilities among
such,&#8221; replied the missionary.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said Mr. Brown, &#8220;you
must become enthusiastic too; and when
they see you are in earnest, they will help
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But are there not some &#8216;old fogies&#8217;
mixed up among the crowd, who would oppose
radical measures of any kind?&#8221; mildly
suggested the missionary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Plenty of them,&#8221; quickly replied Mr.
Brown. &#8220;It is especially so in religious
matters&mdash;here they seem to have the most
influence, being well-meaning, orderly and
good men; but holding the idea that the old
routine must be followed, they oppose any
change, or any &#8216;new measure,&#8217; as they call
it; and being men of standing in the community,
the result is, in many cases, that
nothing is accomplished.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are these old measure men inclined to
oppose the temperance cause, prayer-meetings,
revivals and Sunday-schools by any decided
action?&#8221; seriously inquired the missionary.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>&#8220;Some will, and carry others with them,
who otherwise might be made active members
in the Church; as they are, you cannot
tell them from non-professors,&#8221; rejoined Mr.
Brown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are these leading men hard to win
over?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not all,&#8221; answered Mr. Brown; &#8220;they
are mostly well-meaning, and if you can convince
them of a more effective way, they will
go with you; but some are very bigoted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What arguments do they generally use
against our reformatory movements?&#8221; continued
the missionary.</p>

<p>&#8220;They generally rely upon the supposition
that our forefathers lived and died without
any of these &#8216;new-fangled doctrines,&#8217; and
if they went to Heaven without them, we
can too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, don&#8217;t they see,&#8221; queried the missionary,
&#8220;that the Bible is full of temperance,
(Acts xxiv. 25; Gal. v. 23; 2 Pet. i. 6; 1<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Cor. ix. 25; 1 Titus i. 8); of revivals (Acts ii. 2),
and prayer-meetings (Acts i. 13, 14; xvi.
13; xii. 12; Luke xxii. 39-46)? There are
also evident commands for teaching the
Scriptures to the children, as is done in the
Sabbath-school (Gen. xviii. 19; Deut. xxxii.
46; xi. 18, 19; 2 Tim. iii. 15). I do not think
they would call these things new, if they
would prayerfully study God&#8217;s Word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you would take up these points at
the proper time, and give them a full Scriptural
illustration,&#8221; replied Mr. Brown. &#8220;I
think it would be acceptable to the people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will do so; but on Tuesday night I
will dwell entirely upon the utility of Sunday-schools.&#8221;</p>

<p>The hour for singing-school had arrived,
and the children had gone, taking with them
an &#8220;Appointment&#8221; written by the missionary,
to be handed to the teacher; and they had
not forgotten their cards and papers, which
they intended to exhibit.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>After the singing was over, the teacher read,
&#8220;God willing, the Sunday-school missionary
will deliver a lecture on the subject of Sunday-schools,
and, if practicable, organize a
school here next Tuesday evening, at early
candle-light.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is it?&#8221; &#8220;What is a Sunday-school
like?&#8221; were questions asked all around, but
were left unanswered. In the meantime,
Henry and Eliza&#8217;s cards and papers had
been going the rounds from hand to hand.
A general confusion and excitement ensued,
ending in a resolve that they must all come
on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>The news of the appointment spread like
wildfire; the children were excited by the
exaggerated descriptions of the cards and
papers, and were unanimous in their desire
for a Sunday-school.</p>

<small><i>THE MISSIONARY PREACHES.</i></small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">ON Tuesday, a beautiful evening closed
the day. At an early hour, the parents,
together with quite a number of children,
also the youth of this and other neighborhoods,
were on their way to hear what the
stranger had to say; some having made up
their minds for, and others against the Sunday-school.</p>

<p>The old school-house was crowded with
expectant ones, awaiting the arrival of the
&#8220;Great Speaker,&#8221; as he had been reported.</p>

<p>There was a little grove in a ravine behind
the barn at Mr. Brown&#8217;s; this secluded spot
the missionary sought before starting to fill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
his appointment. Here he laid his case before
God, asking for preparation of heart, for
wisdom, for strength, for words, and, above
all, for the power of the Spirit and the ensealing
of the truth upon the hearts of his
hearers.</p>

<p>Do you wonder that his lecture on that
night was endued with power from on high?</p>

<p>Mr. Brown offered to take him to the
school-house in his wagon, but as he preferred
walking, he went in company with the
children, one on each side of him. Their
prattling conversation made his heart glad,
and he longed to lead all the little ones to
the Saviour.</p>

<p>As he entered and took his place at the
desk in the school-room, a deep silence pervaded
the audience. After offering up a
silent prayer, he asked the people to sing a
hymn, and all joined in the glorious old tune,
&#8220;Coronation,&#8221; with a will. After a short, solemn
and impressive prayer, he called the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
attention of his hearers to the following portion
of God&#8217;s Word: &#8220;Therefore shall ye
lay up these my words in your heart and in
to your soul, and bind them for a sign upon
your hand, that they may be as frontlets between
your eyes. And ye shall teach them
to your children, speaking of them in thine
house, and when thou walkest by the way,
when thou liest down, and when thou risest
up.&#8221; Deut. xi. 18, 19.</p>

<p>He treated his subject so simply that the
children could understand, and with an
earnestness that commanded the attention of
all. After showing the imperative duty of
teaching the Scriptures to our children, and
that some <i>could</i> not, and others <i>would</i> not,
thus properly teach them, he said that it
was the duty of all Christians to see to it
that they were taught. To gather them
together on Sunday for religious instruction,
was the most appropriate and feasible
method. He appealed to the minds and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
hearts of his audience in such a way as to
force their assent to the truth of his propositions;
and that, too, from persons who had
come with feelings of determined hostility.
After another prayer, and the singing of a
hymn, he exhibited his Sunday-school books
and papers, picture cards and prize tickets,
giving to each in turn a proper explanation
of its uses, and closed with an appeal to the
people to organize a Sunday-school at once.</p>

<p>Upon this, a man arose and said, with considerable
faltering, that he objected to any
such &#8220;snap judgment&#8221; being taken; that
this Sunday-school fuss was got up by a set
of loafers, who were too lazy to work, to
swindle their living out of the earnings of
honest people. And he, for one, was not
going to be led by them. Having thus made
known his opinion, he sat down. This man
was no other than Mr. Steele, with whom we
are already acquainted.</p>

<p>The missionary did not think it prudent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
cast pearls where they would be trampled
under foot, so he left the future action to the
people.</p>

<p>The short speech of Mr. Steele encouraged
those who were prejudiced against any &#8220;innovations,&#8221;
and some confusion ensued. Mr.
Brown arose and said that he was sorry that
the gentleman who had just taken his seat
had thrown out such unwarranted insinuations;
and as he did not offer the slightest
evidence to sustain his assertions, he did not
feel inclined to give this speech the least
credit, and would therefore move that the
gentleman, Mr. Steele, be requested to prove
the charges made against those who, with the
present lecturer, are endeavoring to organize
and establish Sunday-schools. This was seconded
by three or four, and almost unanimously
carried. The time of meeting determined
upon was the following Thursday night.</p>

<p>The excitement now became general; there
being a division of sentiment among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
people, and as this was leading to confusion
and impropriety, the meeting was dismissed;
but this only gave more liberty, and instead of
a calm discussion of the question, extravagant
assertions were made, and hasty, inconsiderate
conclusions formed, leading to angry
words.</p>

<p>A number sought acquaintance with the
missionary, and the result of the meeting was
that he had warmer friends and more determined
enemies than before.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.<br />

<small><i>MR. STEELE&#8217;S MEETING.</i></small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">EARLY on Wednesday morning, the missionary
was on his way to canvass the district.
He met with opposition and encouragement
among the parents, but the children and
most of the young people were decidedly in
favor of a Sunday-school. His humility and sincerity
won him many friends, and before
Thursday night came he had disarmed much
of the opposition.</p>

<p>The time for Mr. Steele to prove his charges
having arrived, the house was filled; indeed
many were unable to get in. This, to the
missionary, was an omen of good; and he
felt calm and strong in faith. The angry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
scowls of the opposition made no impression
upon his feelings, for he well remembered the
Saviour had said: &#8220;Think not that I am come
to send peace on earth; I came not to send
peace, but a sword.&#8221;</p>

<p>As this was Mr. Steele&#8217;s meeting, he was on
hand. After some delay he arose, and with a
great deal of agitation said he reckoned that
the time to begin had come, and he guessed he
would proceed. He consequently commenced
his harangue against the Sabbath-school, and
those interested in its success. But being ignorant
of the merits of the subject he had
undertaken to discuss, he, of course, failed to
convince any one. As to his proving his
charges, he did not even make the attempt.
Even his friends felt that the effort was a total
failure, and he sat down without a single expression
of applause or commendation from
those present.</p>

<p>Some one here asked him what he proposed
doing in the matter.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>He replied that every one might do as he
pleased, but as to himself he would never pay
a cent toward the thing, nor ever enter one,
nor allow any of his family to be taught in
such a shabby concern as a Sunday-school.</p>

<p>A slight effort at cheering, by a few worthless
fellows, was made at this boasting declaration,
and he felt as though he was of some
importance, and took his seat with a smile of
complacency.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown was deeply wounded by the uncharitable
remarks of Mr. Steele, and he now
arose to speak. Every eye was upon him.
He commenced by referring to the arguments
advanced by the missionary in favor of Sunday-schools;
speaking of the positive duty
devolving upon all Christians to teach their
children the Scriptures, and appealing to the
judgment of the whole audience whether any
one of the statements made had been refuted
by Mr. Steele. He also alluded to the
great utility of such an institution, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
commented upon the abuse received by persons
particularly interested in the cause; he also
quoted from Paul, that we should &#8220;prove all
things, and hold fast that which is good,&#8221; and
not let our prejudices condemn, and our bigotry
abuse every one and every thing that is
new.</p>

<p>Although there was little expressed sympathy
with Mr. Steele and his remarks, it
was evident that quite a number could not
overcome their prejudices, and stood upon
what some termed &#8220;neutral ground.&#8221; Unfortunately
for such persons, in morality and
religion there can be no neutral ground.
Christ says, &#8220;He that is not for me is against
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The missionary now opened his satchel,
and taking out a Sunday-school book, laid
it upon the table; remarking, that instead of
trying to fleece the people out of their money,
he would propose to give them fifty volumes
like the one before them, if they would make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
up money to pay for fifty more, and agree to
organize a Sunday-school.</p>

<p>The night being now far spent, Mr. Brown
proposed to have another meeting on Sunday
morning at 10 o&#8217;clock, with the object of
organizing a Sunday-school. This was agreed
to, and the people separated.</p>

<p>A good old Christian, by the name of
Law, took the missionary along with him. He
was one of those who had long desired a
better state of things in the community. The
missionary explained to him all that he wished
to know, and his already favorable opinions of
the Sunday-school were greatly strengthened.
From Mr. Law&#8217;s the missionary went to the
next neighbor, who was one of those who
professed neutrality in the matter. He appeared
to fear the missionary, and did not
give him a very warm reception. He said
&#8220;yes&#8221; to everything the missionary said, but
was really in doubt as to whether he did not
mean &#8220;no.&#8221; Convinced against his will, he hid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
his convictions by making a doubtful show
for the other side. He was left neither cold
nor hot; and his hesitating promise that he
would come and bring his children to the
meeting, was scarcely to be interpreted at all.</p>

<p>Leaving here, the missionary went to Mr.
Adams. He was one of the opposition; but
he was a frank man, and possessed a superficial
knowledge of the Scriptures. He invited
the missionary in, intending to &#8220;give
him a short battle.&#8221;</p>

<p>After some preliminaries, the objector
brought forward his charges, which were
about the same as those advanced by Mr.
Steele. The missionary answered these one
by one, and so plainly showed the utility of
the Sunday-school, that Mr. Adams would
gladly have escaped from the missionary&#8217;s
presence, and from the conviction forced
upon his mind by the truth. His sense of
politeness alone prevented him from leaving
the house.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>As he was a professed Christian, and indeed
a leading member of the church, the missionary
asked the privilege of praying with
the family; this, upon the same principle of
courtesy, could not be denied. The missionary
had done all that he could in his weakness,
and he now laid the case before God; asking
for His blessing, His spirit and convincing
power. What arguments failed to do, sincere
and earnest prayer accomplished.</p>

<p>Sunday-school Agents, Leaders in the
Church, Ministers of the Gospel, do you ask
God in earnest prayer to bless your labors?
Are your efforts made to do good, or to be
heard and seen? In the fear of God; in
view of the final judgment; examine yourselves
in this matter.</p>

<small><i>MR. MASON AND MR. WILSON.</i></small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">ANOTHER clear, calm Sunday morning
dawned. All nature seemed to be at
rest. The missionary had staid over night with
a newly married couple. He found them kind
and social, and the young man volunteered
his help in the Sunday-school. The hour of
ten came, and the school-house was again filled
to overflowing. The children were there in
full force. God bless the children! What hopes
filled their little hearts! Visions of books,
papers and pictures floated before their eyes.</p>

<p>The missionary was called upon to conduct
the exercises. After singing and prayer,
he took as the basis of a few remarks, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
words: &#8220;Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon
son of Jonas, &#8216;lovest thou me more than
these?&#8217; He saith unto Him, &#8216;yea, Lord, thou
knowest that I love thee.&#8217; He saith unto
him, &#8216;<i>feed my lambs</i>.&#8217;&#8221; What he said was to the
point, and disarmed all open opposition. A
vote was taken on the question: &#8220;Will we now
organize a Sunday-school?&#8221; This was carried
by a handsome majority. When the chairman
said: &#8220;All who are opposed rise to your feet,&#8221;
Mr. Steele and a few others did so, but the
odds against them being so great, they were
ashamed, and soon left.</p>

<p>A superintendent was now elected, and
happily the choice fell upon Mr. Brown. The
subordinate officers were chosen in like manner.
A collection was then taken up, which
proved to be a liberal one.</p>

<p>The children were formed into classes, and
volunteer teachers appointed. A Bible class
for adults was also formed, and a short lesson
assigned for the following Sunday. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
doxology was sung, and the people were dismissed.
Thus the good cause seemed to be
triumphing over opposition.</p>

<p>A man who lived in an adjoining settlement
had come to this meeting, and being
favorably impressed with the appearance and
manner of the missionary, and the Sunday-school
movement, he invited him to pay a
visit to the settlement in which he lived, and
endeavor to organize a school there.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will come,&#8221; was the laconic reply to the
man who gave the invitation. &#8220;I will be
there by Monday evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>After obtaining proper directions for finding
the place, he took leave of this friend and
returned with Mr. Brown. The remainder of
the afternoon was employed in giving the superintendent
of the newly organized school
all needful instructions as to its management,
and the best methods of teaching. They both
felt happy over the prospects of the enterprise.</p>

<p>Again we find the devoted laborer in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
vineyard of the Lord, acting upon his Master&#8217;s
command. He is now on his way to the neighboring
settlement. His journey lay through
wood and valley, over hills and prairies&mdash;the
latter, however, not very extensive. Reaching
the settlement, he, in due time, arrived at
the house of his friend, where everything had
been made ready for his reception. A meal
was prepared in a short time, and the missionary
partook of it with a decided relish. The
long walk and the cordial welcome tended
greatly to sharpen his appetite.</p>

<p>The reader will pardon a slight digression.
We have followed this servant of God through
shadow and sunshine, in his efforts to promote
the interests of Christ&#8217;s kingdom. Let us
compare his lot with that of many ministers of
the Gospel. Alas! how many are there who,
because they cannot possess life&#8217;s luxuries as
well as its comforts, abandon a field in which
they might do good! The master has said:
&#8220;He that taketh not his <i>cross</i> and followeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
after me, is not worthy of me.&#8221; Coming back
to our missionary, we find him chatting with
the children. They were at first rather shy, but
his gentle, winning manner soon brought them
to his side, and in a very short time they were
most excellent friends. In the meantime their
father, Mr. Mason, had returned (having been
necessarily absent), and welcomed the missionary
to his home. As soon as the chores
were done, they sat down by a bright fire and
entered into conversation. They did not discuss
the various topics of the day, nor dissect
the characters of their neighbors for the purpose
of whiling the time away; but Christ&#8217;s
cause was their theme.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are the people here generally in favor of
Sunday-schools?&#8221; inquired the missionary.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not think they are,&#8221; frankly answered
Mr. Mason. &#8220;Few of them care much about
anything religious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you preaching or prayer-meetings?&#8221;
continued the missionary.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>&#8220;Sometimes prayer-meetings are started,
but they die out directly. Preaching is kept
up most of the time by this, that, or the other
denomination, but it seems to amount to but
little. There is no increase or life about the
Church; and you can scarcely tell a member
from a non-professor. Indeed, Christianity has
fallen into disrepute, and Christ and His
cause are brought to an open shame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How sad!&#8221; replied the missionary, much
moved.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mr. Mason, &#8220;it is a great pity;
but there seems to be little help for it. Several
have <i>tried</i> to do something, but all to no
purpose. Somehow or other there was no
life in it, and Satan, with a few rowdies, defeated
every attempt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are all the people so indifferent?&#8221; asked
the missionary, with great anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know that they are; but the
exercises were so cold and lifeless that the
people had no faith in them; and the conduct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
of many of the members was so bad, that their
influence rather tended to drive men from the
Church than lead them to the Saviour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are the morals of the children, as a
general thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, where the church members do
not perform their duty, their children are neglected;
and when they fail to do right we can
hardly expect anything better from worldlings
and sinners. Lying, cursing, fighting,
disobedience and Sabbath-breaking are common
sins among the children. The youth
drink, gamble and frolic, and some are guilty
of heinous crimes. But, thank God,&#8221; added
Mr. Mason, &#8220;there are some noble exceptions
both among the children and youth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must pray God to help us to reform
this awful state of morals and religion. We
must labor and pray until a great revival is
brought about in the Church and among the
people,&#8221; said the missionary, earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you talk of a <i>revival</i> here they will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
down on you, both in and out of the Church,&#8221;
said the deeply-interested man.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will exercise prudence, and call our
effort by a more acceptable name; we will call
it a <i>protracted prayer-meeting</i>,&#8221; added the missionary,
smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;That will be equally obnoxious; the professors
generally say, &#8216;we pay the preacher to
do the praying for us, and that is enough;&#8217;
and the irreligious, of course, have little interest
in such things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think they would say to a
temperance meeting?&#8221; queried the missionary.</p>

<p>&#8220;That will bring down upon you all the
loafers, tipplers and rumsellers; indeed nearly
all the church members &#8216;take some,&#8217; and they
would all unite in opposition to you,&#8221; sadly
rejoined Mr. Mason.</p>

<p>&#8220;All these things must be overcome. And
if we are faithful in using the means God has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
given us, the work will be accomplished. I
do not despair,&#8221; added the missionary.</p>

<p>&#8220;May God help us to do our duty!&#8221; said
Mr. Mason, as he laid the family Bible on the
stand for evening devotion.</p>

<small><i>MISSIONARY VISITS.</i></small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE missionary started on his visiting tour
among the people of the settlement on
Tuesday morning. The first house to which he
came indicated a good share of worldly comfort.
He met the owner repairing the garden-gate,
and accosted him with, &#8220;Good
morning.&#8221; The man looked at him as if
hesitating whether or not to reply, and said,
&#8220;How d&#8217;ye do.&#8221; The missionary, still undaunted,
made some remarks of a commonplace
nature, which were answered in monosyllables.
As the missionary felt that he had
no time to waste, he came at once to the subject
of his mission.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>&#8220;So you&#8217;re the fellow getting up Sunday-schools.
I thought you were by your looks;
but let me tell you at once that &#8216;you&#8217;re barking
up the wrong tree here,&#8217; and the sooner
you &#8216;play quits&#8217; the better. I have no time to
fool away in talking about such nonsense.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But pray tell what objections you can
have to teaching the young the Holy Scriptures?&#8221;
mildly interposed the missionary.</p>

<p>&#8220;I just now told you that I had no time to
waste in talking to idlers, and I expect you to
take the hint,&#8221; sharply retorted the unreasonable
man.</p>

<p>Finding that there was no chance at present
to do anything with him, the missionary bid
him &#8220;Good-day,&#8221; and started. The man replied
with a triumphant &#8220;Good-bye, sir,&#8221; at
the same time casting toward him a sneering
look.</p>

<p>As the missionary was passing the barn, he
met a little girl, to whom he gave a card for
herself and another for the family.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>On crossing a little stream he met a young
lady on horseback; to her he handed a tract,
entitled, &#8220;Are you Saved?&#8221; A slight tremor
was visible when she read this; the question
demanded an answer. Seeing how the title
affected her, he prayed God to bless the words
to her salvation.</p>

<p>He did not go far until he came to a place
where two roads crossed at right angles; so
he sat down a moment to rest and consider
which road to take. Whilst sitting, a man
with a wagon and a fine span of horses came
along. His countenance bespoke a kind
heart, and the missionary rose to salute him.
He responded with a hearty &#8220;Good-day,&#8221; and
an invitation to take a ride, if the stranger were
going his way. The missionary had to confess
that he did not know where he was going,
and unfolded his object in visiting the settlement.</p>

<p>The man said that he had heard of a Sunday-school
being organized at Clear Creek,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
but he was not up when the meeting was held,
and knew but little of the nature of the institution.
Still he would be willing to &#8220;give the
thing a trial,&#8221; if it did not <i>cost too much</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;As to the cost,&#8221; said the missionary, &#8220;that
will depend upon the number of books, papers,
maps and other helps you get. But I will
agree to donate to your school, if you establish
one, half of a good library.&#8221;</p>

<p>This opened the eyes of the man to their
utmost extent, and he exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you don&#8217;t say! That don&#8217;t look
like speculating or swindling people out
of their money, as they say of you around
here. I never did believe the half I heard; it
didn&#8217;t seem reasonable to me. But,&#8221; continued
he, &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe that we can make
it go. Everybody I have talked to is down
on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you be willing to assist me, and
bring your family long enough to test the
matter?&#8221; inquired the missionary.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do my best, if things are as you say. I
believe the children ought to be instructed in
the Bible the moment they are capable of understanding
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are there any others that you think would
join us in the work?&#8221;</p>

<p>The stranger, Mr. Wilson, hesitated, and
then said; &#8220;People here seem to be dead in
regard to anything of this kind. Whether
we succeed or not, a general fight over the
question will, if it can possibly stir them up,
be of some use. Make the appointment, and
I&#8217;ll stir them out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When shall it be?&#8221; inquired the missionary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put it on Friday night; there is spelling-school
in our school-house to-morrow night,
and I&#8217;ll go down and have it given out, and
the whole neighborhood will know it,&#8221; said
Mr. Wilson, with great animation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Providence permitting, I will be there,&#8221;
said the missionary.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>&#8220;And give us a speech, telling all about
the Sunday-school,&#8221; suggested Mr. Wilson.</p>

<p>As the missionary was about to offer his
hand and say good-bye, Mr. Wilson said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you go with me and stay until Friday?
I can accommodate you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you, but I will not visit the neighborhood
until Friday, and then I will come to
your house and we will go to the meeting together,&#8221;
replied the missionary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, perhaps that will be best,&#8221; rejoined
Mr. Wilson, and passed on. Calling back, he
said: &#8220;Take the road up the hill; it will lead
you through the most thickly settled portion
of this neighborhood.&#8221; The missionary nodded
his head and took the road as directed.
He met with various successes in his itinerancy
until Thursday evening, when he was
shamefully treated by a man known as &#8217;Squire
Hunt, one of the leading men of the settlement.
The missionary bore the insults meekly,
but upheld the cause of Christ manfully.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX.<br />

<small><i>OPPOSITION.</i></small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">ACCORDING to promise, the missionary
was at Mr. Wilson&#8217;s house, and he, together
with the family, went to the school-house.
The words of his text were, &#8220;Train
up a child in the way he should go, and when
he is old he will not depart from it.&#8221; Prov.
xxii. 6. He approached his subject with
caution, for the people before him were restless
and excited; but he gradually unfolded
the solemn truth contained in the text. He
addressed himself to the parents, especially to
the mothers. His apparent sincerity and
great earnestness overcame the prejudices of
many, but still a large majority were opposed,
or cared little about the matter.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>The &#8217;Squire got up and denounced the
speaker, Sunday-schools and Temperance
societies. He was frequently cheered; and
those who had been won by the earnest eloquence
of the speaker, were now carried
away by the majority, and were inclined to
&#8220;follow the multitude to do evil.&#8221; The
&#8217;Squire then called upon the people to decide
by a vote, whether they would have a Sunday-school
or not, shouting out: &#8220;All who are in
favor of a Sunday-school here, rise to your
feet.&#8221; Mr. Wilson and Mr. Mason sprang to
their feet like heroes, their intrepidity encouraging
some of the timid and wavering,
who, together with their children, made quite
a respectable vote. After these were again
seated, all who were opposed to a Sunday-school
were called upon to rise. Instantly
several of the most bitter opposers, who were
waiting for the word, were up; others, soon
followed, while the &#8217;Squire was urging the
fearful and lukewarm with, &#8220;Up! up! I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
know you are opposed; show your colors!&#8221;
and in this way succeeded in getting many
to rise, who did not really intend to have
anything to do with the matter. He then
declared the majority opposed, and in triumph
took his seat.</p>

<p>Mr. Mason arose and asked the majority
to concede to those who desired it the privilege
of holding Sunday-school in the school-house
undisturbed.</p>

<p>This very reasonable request was opposed
by the &#8217;Squire; but upon the vote being taken,
the privilege was granted. This was something
gained, and the missionary was thankful
for it, although he and his little band
were openly subjected to sneers and abuse.
But they had the comforting assurance that
&#8220;all things work together for good to them
that love God.&#8221;</p>

<p>On Saturday morning, the missionary started
for Clear Creek Settlement. On his way
he met a little boy and two little girls.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>&#8220;How do you do, my young friends?&#8221;
kindly began the missionary.</p>

<p>They all smiled pleasantly, but did not say
anything.</p>

<p>&#8220;How old are you, my son?&#8221; continued
he, addressing the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ten, next Christmas; my birthday comes
day before Christmas,&#8221; ingenuously answered
the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;These little girls are your sisters, I
suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; responded the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you read?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, I can read in the &#8216;Introduction,&#8217;
very well; my sister Jane can read too; and
little Betty can spell and read easy words,&#8221;
answered the boy, with some feelings of
pride.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever go to Sunday-school?&#8221; inquired
the missionary.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>No, sir!</i>&#8221; answered the boy, emphatically.
&#8220;We don&#8217;t go to school on Sundays; we go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
on week-days.&#8221; This direct answer caused
the missionary to smile; he continued, however,
with the question, &#8220;Would you like to,
if there were a Sunday-school?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir!&#8221; again replied the boy. &#8220;We
play ball, pitch horse-shoes, or go a fishing
on Sunday, and I like that better than going
to school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think it is wrong to do such
things on Sunday?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; again responded the boy, &#8220;father
and all the neighbors do that on Sunday.&#8221;</p>

<p>The parents then were the examples; and
the children followed. How many parents
thus unwittingly take their children by the
hand and lead them down to death!</p>

<p>&#8220;You all go to meeting sometimes, don&#8217;t
you?&#8221; continued the missionary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, once in a while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t the preacher talk against such
things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes; but nobody cares. Some go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
to the grocery and pitch horse-shoes for
whisky; and some go to the tavern to play
checkers or such, for a dram, or for fun,&#8221; replied
the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t the preacher talk against drinking
liquor and lying about at the grocery on
Sundays?&#8221; seriously inquired the missionary.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir, <i>he likes it himself</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a bad thing to drink whisky,&#8221; said
the missionary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; quickly responded the boy;
&#8220;last night they had a spree at the grocery,
and Bill Jones liken&#8217;d to&#8217;ve killed Tom
Miller with his knife; and Ace Ross knocked
Old Butt&#8217;s eye out. Father says they have
a law suit to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a pity!&#8221; said the missionary,
shaking his head. &#8220;Do you live far from
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About a mile,&#8221; answered the boy.</p>

<p>The missionary then gave each of the
children a card, and explained to them, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
far as they were capable of understanding,
what a Sunday-school was like; and they
then said that they would like to go to such
a school. He told them of an appointment
for Sunday afternoon at 3 o&#8217;clock, in the
school-house near Mr. Wilson&#8217;s, and invited
them to come and bring their parents along;
he then said &#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; and left them.</p>

<p>Having detained himself longer than he
supposed, he was compelled to hurry on, as
he had quite a distance to go before he would
reach Mr. Brown&#8217;s. As he was passing
through a lane, after coming within the
bounds of Clear Creek Settlement, he found
two men lying in a fence-corner, drunk! He
tried to rouse them, but failed in so doing,
for they were past consciousness. Continuing
on, he soon came to the grocery. Happily for
the missionary, the crowd within was all
excitement over a &#8220;drinking game;&#8221; that is,
several engaged in playing cards for a treat of
the whole company. Before he had passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
out of hearing, a great shout and uproar at
this den of sin, told him that the game was
up, and the treat was being given. In his
heart he then resolved that a Temperance
society should be established in that place,
and he prayed God to help him in the undertaking.
After arriving at Mr. Brown&#8217;s, he
could not but compare the revolting scenes
he had left behind him, with the pleasant,
social intercourse he was now enjoying.</p>

<small><i>SUNDAY-SCHOOL ORGANIZED&mdash;LOCAL
PREACHER.</i></small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AT the appointed time, on the Holy morning,
the missionary and Mr. Brown were
in the Sunday-school, ready for action. A
number had already collected, and after the
opening exercises, the missionary delivered a
short and impressive address, in which he exhorted
the teachers to aim at the conversion
of those placed under their instruction, to be
always punctual, to set a godly example, and,
finally, not to grow weary in well-doing, but
continue the work through evil as well as
good report; and reminded them of the
reward on the final day of reckoning.</p>

<p>Everything passed off well; the children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
were pleased, and the parents greatly encouraged.
The opposition could see nothing to
condemn, but Mr. Steele and a few others
laughed at the &#8220;simple thing,&#8221; and hooted at
the idea of sending their children.</p>

<p>According to arrangement, Mr. Mason
came with his horses and wagon for the purpose
of taking the missionary to the other
settlement. It had been announced to the
people that an effort to organize a Sunday-school
would be made on the afternoon of
this day. By 3 o&#8217;clock many had come
together; some for the purpose of taking part
in the enterprise, and others merely to look
on. The school was started, though under
less auspicious circumstances than the one at
Clear Creek; yet it was a beginning. The
result was in God&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p>During the week that followed, the missionary
visited the families of the settlement,
urging the parents either to take or send
their children to the Sunday-school. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
kindness and persuasive address won him
more friends than promises. The force of
public opinion against the school made many
fear to take part in it; the most of the
people, however, began to treat him with respect.</p>

<p>On Thursday evening he again preached.
He was prepared for the occasion, not by a
written sermon with rounded paragraphs and
beautifully-finished sentences, but by constant,
fervent prayer, and thoughtful meditation.
He had contemplated the state of the
people, and the weight of immortal souls lay
heavily upon his heart; and, above all, he remembered
his commission and his great
responsibility, for the Almighty had said: &#8220;If
the watchman see the sword come and blow not
the trumpet, and the people are not warned;
if the sword come and take any person from
among them, he is taken away in his iniquity;
but his blood will I require at the
watchman&#8217;s hand.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>The opponents found that they had an
earnest man to contend with; a man with
the whole armor on, and one who could
wield the &#8220;sword of the spirit&#8221; with power;
that he was not only &#8220;mighty in the Scriptures,&#8221;
but &#8220;full of the Holy Ghost;&#8221; and
they saw that if they did not immediately
&#8220;do something,&#8221; he would be &#8220;master of the
situation.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they went to work, as is usual in such
cases, to misrepresent his language and misconstrue
his meaning; to change the truth
into falsehood, by adding, distorting and detracting.
His character, too, was assailed, and
scandalous stories invented and circulated
in order to ruin him; but he heeded them
not; for the Saviour had said: &#8220;Blessed are
ye when men shall revile you and persecute
you, and say all manner of evil against you
falsely for my sake; rejoice and be exceeding
glad, for great is your reward in
Heaven.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>Whilst the missionary was still in this
neighborhood, he was called to the bedside
of a dying woman. Now that the hour of dissolution
was rapidly approaching, she began
to have misgivings about her fitness for Heaven.
She had been in the Church for a number of
years, but was not a lively stone in the building.
After conversation and prayer with the
missionary, her faith was strengthened, and
she felt ready to go at the Master&#8217;s call.
Thus did this servant of God do good upon
every possible occasion. Having learned
that a local preacher, who lived a few miles
distant, was opposed to Sunday-schools, he
determined to call upon him and talk over the
matter.</p>

<p>The missionary, upon reaching the home
of the preacher, found him ready to start out
to fill an appointment at a place about six
miles distant. He treated the missionary
coldly, and boastingly told him that he and
his people had gotten along for many years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
without Sunday-schools, and he guessed they
were as good as those who had them, and
reckoned they could still make out without
his services; and to tell those who sent him
&#8220;to attend to their own business and let
other people&#8217;s alone.&#8221; Not waiting for a
reply, the preacher gave his horse a cut with
the whip, and was off. There was consequently
no alternative left the missionary but
to retrace his steps. This he did, and attended
to the duties set apart for the day.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding opposition, the work went
on; and the friends of the Sunday-school
became daily more respected by its enemies.</p>

<small><i>MR. KERR AND HIS FAMILY.</i></small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">UPON one occasion, as the missionary was
passing through the western portion of
Clear Creek Settlement, he called at a house
whose surroundings seemed familiar. The
man of the house, too, appeared to him as
one he had seen before, but he could not
remember exactly where.</p>

<p>After some general remarks, he said to
the man, &#8220;I almost fancy that I have seen
you before to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you have,&#8221; the man replied,
with considerable agitation; and continued,
&#8220;Do you not remember some time ago,
standing at a gate and requesting a farmer to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
allow you to stay all night, and being refused,
and that there was another man there
beside the owner of the place?&#8221;</p>

<p>The missionary said he did.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you remember, also, that you gave a
little boy and girl some picture-cards and
tracts?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; said the missionary.</p>

<p>&#8220;And one for each of the men at the
barn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I well remember that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was that man,&#8221; said he, somewhat confused,
&#8220;and when Mr. Steele refused to let
you stay, I, like a coward, approved of it.
Don&#8217;t you remember?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I believe you did,&#8221; gently replied
the missionary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I did that very wicked thing, and
now ask your pardon. I have had no rest
since, on account of it,&#8221; said the man with
emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have long since forgiven you,&#8221; calmly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
replied the missionary. &#8220;Such things do not
move me; I count them as nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you had suffered what I did from them,
you would count them a good deal. I heard
you preach last Sunday, and if I had not been
ashamed, I would have made a public confession
of my wickedness. I thank God that
you have come this way,&#8221; continued the
humbled man with faltering voice, and stretching
out his hand for reconciliation and forgiveness.</p>

<p>Joyfully the servant of Christ gave Mr.
Kerr (whom our readers must have recognized)
his hand, and their friendship was
sealed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kerr, who had been absent at the
time of the missionary&#8217;s arrival, now came in.
She recognized him at once, and welcomed
him with unfeigned kindness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where in the world have you been since
you were here last month?&#8221; inquired the
free-spoken woman. &#8220;I wondered and wondered,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
she continued, &#8220;what had become of
you in the big storm. I expected nothing
else than to hear that you got killed in that
dreadful rain. It was awful! I declare I
thought our house would go!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; pleasantly replied the missionary,
&#8220;I put up without &#8216;leave or license,&#8217; at a hut
out on Walnut Creek, where I was taken
care of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, nobody lives out there that I know
of,&#8221; said Mr. Kerr. &#8220;Let me see; was it
about due west from where you left us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very nearly, I think,&#8221; said the missionary,
at the same time smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sir, I know of but one family that
ever lived in that swampy, sickly, mosquito
hole, and two or three of them died there
and the rest moved away long ago,&#8221; replied
Mr. Kerr, instantly adding, &#8220;What is the
man&#8217;s name that lives there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed I cannot give the name,&#8221; answered
the missionary, with such a look of mischief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
that Mrs. Kerr declared that he was only
joking. &#8220;It was at the place you mention,
no doubt, that I staid. There were two graves
on a hill near the house, which was in a very
dilapidated condition, and the yard was overgrown
with weeds and briars; indeed, everything
presented the appearance of having been
long deserted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was Mr. Kelly&#8217;s home once, but the
mosquitoes and chills drove him out. It was
well he left, or the whole family would soon
have perished there. It is a poor country
compared with this,&#8221; explained Mr. Kerr.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you said that you were well taken
care of; I&#8217;d like to know who took care of
you,&#8221; said Mrs. Kerr, with a mischievous
twinkle in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Lord took care of me,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I did not think of that;&#8221; said she.
&#8220;Did you keep dry in the old hut in that
dreadful storm?&#8221; she added; and in the
same breath continued, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you think the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
whole thing would blow down over your
head?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was pretty well sheltered from the wind
and rain, but I really did think more than
once that all would go down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was sure our house was gone,&#8221; earnestly
resumed Mrs. Kerr, &#8220;and I expected
nothing else than the death of all of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When we are ready,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;death
is no evil.&#8221;</p>

<p>This practical reply rather embarrassed
her, and for a moment she was at a loss to
know what to say next; so he continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;To crush the body is a matter of little
consequence; but the soul, the immortal being
that inhabits this house of clay, is of immense
value. Could we fully realize the fact
that nothing dies but the clay we inhabit, we
would not dread the change.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Kerr listened attentively, but made no
reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you be so kind as to give us an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
account of your troubles on that dreadful
night?&#8221; asked Mr. Kerr.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said he, and he related to
them the long list of trials, dangers and privations
through which he had passed.</p>

<p>Tears more than once filled the eyes of
the eager listeners. &#8220;And now,&#8221; said Mr.
Kerr, after the missionary had finished, &#8220;I
must give you some of my experience since
we parted. If you remember one of the cards
you gave the children, read, &#8216;And these shall
go away into everlasting punishment, but the
righteous into life eternal;&#8217; <i>that</i> fell into my
hands. When I read those words the irresistible
conviction struck me that <i>I</i> would be
one of &#8216;<i>these</i>,&#8217; and a fearful looking for judgment
to come took hold of me. All the way
home I seemed to hear the words, &#8216;And these
shall go away into everlasting punishment.&#8217;
I wished again and again that I had only
taken you with me; or at least have defended
you against the unreasonableness of Mr. Steele.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
But that was now too late, and I groaned
under the lashes of my guilty conscience.
Upon reaching home, my wife told me that
you had been here and prayed with the family.
I suffered greatly, and was at length compelled
to &#8216;own up&#8217; to my wife, who soon
discovered that all was not right with me&mdash;and
she strongly condemned my action.&#8221; Mr.
Kerr did not cease speaking until he had
made a full confession of the humiliation he
had experienced from a guilty conscience.</p>

<p>The missionary could not but be moved at
the penitent recital; yet he rejoiced that Mr.
Kerr was at last led to the true and only
source of comfort.</p>

<p>After uniting in prayer with the family, the
missionary inquired if they had been to the
Sunday-school.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; heartily replied Mr. Kerr, &#8220;we
were all over last Sunday, and had a delightful
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt; indeed, no one with proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
feelings, and a regard for the eternal interests
of his children or the children of others, can
help being benefited and highly delighted in
a well-ordered Sunday-school,&#8221; said the good
man with emphasis; adding, &#8220;have the books
and papers for which they sent, come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They have,&#8221; rejoined Mr. Kerr, &#8220;and I
verily thought the whole school would go
wild when the box was opened. Indeed, I
was myself considerably excited; and when
each one received a book and a paper, I really
could not refrain from shedding tears, in witnessing
the uncontrollable delight that filled
every heart; and I reproached myself with
bitterness for having been so cowardly as not
to defend this noble institution, when you and
it were assailed by Mr. Steele. To-day, I
thank God for the Sunday-school! and I know
that every family that attends it thanks God
for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May God, the Divine Author of this
institution, foster and bless it to the salvation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
of all who attend it, or are within its holy
influence!&#8221; said the delighted missionary;
adding, &#8220;how is that gentleman who was with
you at the gate getting along?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, pretty well; but he doesn&#8217;t take any
stock in Sunday-schools&mdash;he is very angry at
me for attending, and won&#8217;t speak to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must pray God to give us grace to
bear with him, and try to gain him to our
confidence,&#8221; said the missionary.</p>

<p>The day was passing, and the good man
would have gone on, but Mr. Kerr and his
wife would not hear to it, insisting that he
should remain, at least over night; so he consented
to remain until morning.</p>

<p>By the side of the looking-glass, in the
room which he occupied, he found hanging
a framed card, containing the text, &#8220;And these
shall go away into everlasting punishment,
but the righteous into life eternal.&#8221; Underneath
was written in a plain hand, &#8220;Saved by
grace, through this little card. James Kerr.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>Here was a secret. Mr. Kerr attributed his
conversion to the teaching of this silent monitor.
What a momentous result can hang
upon an insignificant cause! It is said, that
&#8220;the obstruction of a straw at the fountain-head,
may change the channel of a mighty
river.&#8221; Never should we despise the day of
small things.</p>

<small><i>THE TEMPERANCE CAUSE.</i></small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE missionary, after bidding farewell to
the kind friends with whom he had spent
the night, again went on his way, &#8220;Seeking
the lost sheep of the house of Israel.&#8221; He
had not gone far before he met two children,
who proved to be Mr. Steele&#8217;s. Upon entering
into conversation with them, he found that
they remembered him. Their bright, intelligent
answers to his questions, led him to
regret more deeply that they were kept from
the influence of the Sunday-school. The
innate kindness of heart manifested by these
children made him feel that, if properly
trained, they would become useful members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
of society and the church; so, with a view to
using all possible influence in their favor, we
again find him an unwelcome visitor on the
farm of Mr. Steele.</p>

<p>The farmer was at the time unloading wood,
and scarcely noticed the missionary; the latter
soon broached the subject occupying his
thoughts, by saying,</p>

<p>&#8220;My friend, could you not consent to take
your children to Sunday-school once, on
trial?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>No sir!</i>&#8221; he roared; &#8220;and I don&#8217;t want
you to bother me any more about it;&#8221; and
continued, &#8220;work like I do, and let your
betters alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well then,&#8221; said the missionary, &#8220;if you
will not go yourself, will you not permit your
children to go? I know that the school would
be a great benefit to them, and&#8221;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to hear any more of your
nonsense&mdash;just &#8216;git,&#8217; you lazy loafer,&#8221; retorted
the angry man.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>The missionary having failed to accomplish
the object of his visit, left with feelings of
sadness; he went on his way, however, doing
with his might whatsoever his hand found to
do, and he had the pleasure of seeing the
schools increasing in numbers and influence.
This increase was secured only by hard work&mdash;the
various difficulties attending all movements
aiming at changing fixed customs had
to be overcome. One by one, these <i>were</i>
overcome; and although many opposed the
work, and others were indifferent and careless,
most of the best men and women of the
settlements were in favor of the schools. Nor
were they afraid to give their money in support
of the good cause, nor unwilling to
sacrifice ease and pleasure, if necessary; for
they well knew that even in this world they
would receive tenfold reward, and in the
world to come, everlasting life.</p>

<p>Parents, come with your children to the
Sunday-school; it is the nursery of the Lord,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
in which plants are reared for the garden of
Heaven&mdash;the Paradise of God!</p>

<p>Young man, wend your way to the Bible-class,
and thereby shun the temptation of the
Sabbath-breaker and the snares of the transgressor!
And you, young woman, blooming
in all the loveliness of life&#8217;s early dream,
shun the society of those who mock at
religion, and the teachings of the Holy Word,
and fly for your life to the place where prayer
is wont to be made&mdash;where the better qualities
of your nature will be fostered, and your
heart taught to love the Saviour!</p>

<p>The missionary felt that the time had now
come for him to attempt to establish a Temperance
Society among these people for whom
he had been laboring. This was a hazardous
undertaking, where the habits of the people
were so firmly fixed in favor of using intoxicating
liquors as a common beverage. But
a meeting for that purpose was appointed
and the whole country was aroused. Those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
favoring the cause, though few in number,
were willing to take the responsibility, and
the missionary promised to do his best; he
was aware that those of the opposition were
powerful, having on their side <i>appetite</i>, <i>self-interest</i>,
<i>custom</i> and <i>public opinion</i>; but he was
not in the least dismayed; he knew in whom
he had believed; and although the gates of
Hell should oppose, yet they could not prevail.</p>

<p>The time for the meeting having arrived,
after singing a hymn and offering a prayer,
the missionary called the attention of his
large audience to the following words:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who
hath contention? who hath babbling? who
hath wounds without cause? who hath redness
of eyes? They that tarry long at the
wine! They that go to seek mixed wine!
Look not thou upon the wine when it is red,
when it giveth its color in the cup, when it
moveth itself aright; at last it biteth like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
serpent and stingeth like an adder!&#8221; Prov.
xxiii. 29-32.</p>

<p>He then demonstrated by example and
facts, the truth of the answer given to these
questions. Taking up the last part of his
subject in the words, &#8220;At last it biteth,&#8221; &amp;c.,
he gave a most fearful description of the
effects of spirituous liquors upon the human
system and the immortal soul&mdash;depicting with
great force the awful condition of the poor
rum-enslaved, soul-degraded drunkard, both
in body and mind. He held up to their gaze
the emaciated form of a heart-broken wife,
and the half-famished images of her little ones.</p>

<p>He also stated that intoxicating liquors
were the parent of every conceivable sin, and
had extended the catalogue of crimes until
language could scarcely furnish a name for
the atrocious iniquities&mdash;that they filled the
jails and poor-houses, at the expense of the
industrious and good, and also furnished
subjects for the gibbet.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>He alluded also to the groceries, declaring
them the prolific schools in which the young
were taught the rudiments of sin, in idleness,
vulgarity, profanity and drinking&mdash;thus preparing
the way for infamy and crime, and
daily training the mind for the service of
Satan.</p>

<p>He then enforced the command in the text,
not even to look upon it&mdash;saying that the
apostle had commanded to &#8220;Abstain from all
<i>appearance</i> of evil.&#8221;</p>

<p>He also declared that there was no neutral
ground between virtue and vice&mdash;between
supporting and opposing this source of evil;
that we must be either for or against it.</p>

<p>He concluded with an appeal to the people
to save themselves and those around them
from the fangs of the serpent and the sting
of the adder, and to organize at once an
army to fight unto death this monster, Intemperance.</p>

<p>A pledge was written and laid upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
desk; after it was read and a few words of
explanation given, all who wished to join the
society were requested to rise and give their
names. Quite a number of men, women and
children instantly responded to the call;
among them were several tipplers and two
hardened drunkards, whilst the moralist and
the moderate drinker refused to aid in the
work of reformation. There can be no doubt
that these persons were &#8220;stumbling-blocks
in the way of sinners;&#8221; and the position
taken by them sealed the fate of more than
one poor soul. And there were also elders
and deacons, class-leaders and gray-headed
Christians, unwilling to deny themselves of
the &#8220;lusts of the flesh,&#8221; but went with the
&#8220;customs and maxims of the world&#8221;&mdash;taking
their morning dram, their favorite bitters, and
with themselves, training their families in the
way leading to drunkenness and death!</p>

<p>After the people had been dismissed, those
who had given their names signed the pledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
with their own hands, and organized a society,
by electing officers and framing a constitution
for the government and permanent
efficiency of the same. Upwards of sixty
put their names to the &#8220;Declaration of Independence&#8221;
of the tyrant, &#8220;King Alcohol!&#8221;</p>

<p>This was a glorious beginning&mdash;and the
wives and children of those tipplers and
drunkards who joined, shed tears of joy, and
their hearts overflowed with thankfulness to
God and His messenger.</p>

<small><i>THE MISSIONARY&#8217;S DEPARTURE.</i></small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE missionary was loth to depart from
this interesting field of labor, but he was
called, and must obey. He &#8220;threw his mantle&#8221;
upon the shoulders of a noble young man,
whose name was Truman; he was a fluent
speaker, and an enthusiast in whatever he
believed to be right; a giant in courage and
bodily strength, and above all, a conscientious
Christian; to him was consigned the care of
this noble enterprise.</p>

<p>The rum-sellers, with their dupes, were now
aroused to a full sense of the power arrayed
against them; they justified their conduct, by
holding up that of the ministers and leading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
men in the Church, and the latter would
quote Paul&#8217;s advice to Timothy, where he
says, &#8220;Drink no longer water, but use a little
wine for thy stomach&#8217;s sake, and thine often
infirmities.&#8221; Tim. v. 23.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; they boastingly said, &#8220;wine is
commanded as a drink;&#8221; and dared a refutation.</p>

<p>But Truman showed them that this passage
did not only <i>not</i> prove that wine should be
used as a common drink, but <i>proved</i> that it
should only be used as a medicine. He
showed them, too, that Paul was a Temperance
Lecturer, and not afraid to reprove rulers
before whom he &#8220;reasoned of righteousness,
<i>temperance</i>, and judgment to come.&#8221;</p>

<p>The argument that Christ <i>turned water
into wine</i> was also brought forward; the
reply to this was, that there was no evidence
that the miraculous transformation contained
a single particle of intoxicating matter;
whilst every rational supposition, based upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the holy character and pure doctrines of the
Redeemer, would most emphatically declare
that there was not.</p>

<p>Such was the acute and powerful reasoning
of this young man, that minister and deacon
were silenced, if not convinced. Mr. Truman
having been himself snatched from the very
vortex of ruin, his experience in the dens of
infamy, and knowledge of the workings of
the whole traffic, enabled him to bring the
truth home to the hearts of his hearers in a
very effective manner.</p>

<p>As the faithful missionary could delay no
longer, he appointed the time to preach his
farewell sermons in the two settlements. The
first meeting was to be held in the Clear
Creek school-house immediately after Sunday-school.
The day was pleasant and the school
well attended; the exercises of the same
having been completed, order was called, that
all might have the benefit of the missionary&#8217;s
parting advice. He made a short address,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
and then desired each child to come to him,
that he might shake hands and bestow a
trifling gift by which he might be remembered.
He would live in the memories of all,
however, without anything of this kind. A
half hour after the dismissal of the Sunday-school,
the people had assembled to hear the
&#8220;farewell sermon.&#8221; The text was, &#8220;And now,
brethren, I commend you to God and to the
word of His grace, which is able to build
you up, and give you an inheritance among
all them which are sanctified.&#8221; Acts xx. 32.
The sermon which followed was adapted, in
every respect, to the occasion.</p>

<p>As all earthly ties must sooner or later be
sundered, this shepherd and his flock were
compelled to part. It is needless to say that
the separation was sorrowful on both sides.</p>

<p>After leaving Clear Creek Settlement, the
missionary filled his appointment at the other
place; and the parting which took place
here, was but a repetition of the first one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
We now find him on his way to a work
among strangers in a strange land: he knew
what would probably befall him, but he had
counted the cost, and, like Paul, was willing
to endure hardships as a good soldier.</p>

<p>Here, for the present, we will leave this
noble, earnest and devout Christian.</p>

<small><i>WORKING OF THE SABBATH-SCHOOL AND

<p class="drop-cap">IT will now be our purpose to follow some
of the results of the missionary&#8217;s labors
among these people. In our present narrative
we can notice but comparatively few
incidents among the many interesting ones
that transpired, and bring before our reader
but few of the characters connected with the
development of the various plans.</p>

<p>In addition to there being two Sunday-schools
and one Temperance Society firmly
established, the Christian Church under various
names was most effectually aroused&mdash;many
of its members being abundantly blest and
their spiritual strength renewed; backsliders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
were reclaimed, and sinners awakened and
converted: there were also prayer-meetings
held in the different houses among the people.</p>

<p>A general contest, however, was kept up
between those opposed to these institutions,
and their defenders. As soon as it was
generally known that the missionary had
left, the rum-sellers and their adherents
became bold in their opposition; they appeared
to think that, if the shepherd had gone,
the sheep would be scattered. Even some
of the ministers would not come out boldly
on the side of this reformation.</p>

<p>Well did Isaiah prophesy, &#8220;For the leaders
of this people cause them to err; and they
that are led of them are destroyed. Therefore
the Lord shall have no joy in their young
men, neither have mercy on their fatherless
and widows: for every one is a hypocrite,
and an evil doer, and every mouth speaketh
folly.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Temperance Cause met with the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
opposition; and some who stood faithfully by
the Sunday-school could not give up old
habits; although they did not particularly
oppose the Cause, their support was weak
and doubtful. Those who took no interest
in the Sunday-school were decidedly against
temperance. Thus the people became more
and more divided&mdash;and the stinging truths of
Mr. Truman seemed to set everything on
fire; and the Saviour&#8217;s prediction respecting
a house being divided against itself, seemed
to be literally fulfilled. Every demonstration
of truth was met with increased hostility;
and, like Herod and Pilate, even enemies were
made friends in condemning Christ. This,
however, only drove the faithful few nearer
to the Rock of Ages, which was their &#8220;stronghold
in the day of trouble;&#8221; it made them
&#8220;search the Scriptures&#8221; more, and more
vigilant in prayer; relying upon God for
help. Hence they maintained their ground,
and in time were able to make inroads into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the enemy&#8217;s country, taking captives and
plucking brands from the eternal burnings.
Those of the opposition, in order to fully
carry out their principles, were driven to indorse
and defend the lowest morality, and
the coldest and most formal type of Christianity&mdash;and
were compelled to yield to the
caprices of the ungodly by excusing their
faults.</p>

<p>In order more fully to impress the truth
upon the heart, we will now give a brief
narrative of the characters and lives of two
families&mdash;representatives of the parties formed
through the labors of the missionary. The
circumstances bringing him to our notice,
also introduce us to the family of Mr. Steele&mdash;the
other family is that of Mr. Brown, of
the same neighborhood. Through the former
will be illustrated the effects of opposing
religious training as carried on in the Sunday-school;
and through the latter will be shown
the inestimable blessings resulting from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
such training, and the value of vital godliness.</p>

<p>Mr. Steele, as we are already aware, had
two children, George and Mary&mdash;also a wife,
who was naturally a most excellent person;
but the influence of her cold-hearted husband
was not without its effect upon her life. He
claimed to be a church member, but he had
only a &#8220;name to live.&#8221; After years of constant
association with such a person, we need
not wonder that she quietly submitted to him.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown and family, also consisting of a
wife and two children, had always been on
terms of intimacy with Mr. Steele&#8217;s family.
On Saturday afternoon, previous to the opening
of the Sunday-school at Clear Creek
Settlement, George and Mary Steele went to
Mr. Brown&#8217;s on an errand, and received
permission to spend an hour with their friends,
Henry and Eliza; the Sunday-school was
the all-absorbing topic of conversation, and
although George and Mary knew that their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
father was opposed to anything of the kind,
they still hoped that they would be allowed
to go on the following day. No sooner had
they reached home, than they began to tell
their mother, in a very excited manner, about
the Sunday-school. Just as their excitement
was about at its height, their father entered
the room, and in a very gruff manner asked,
what &#8220;all this fuss&#8221; was about. As the song
of the robin ceases at the crack of the rifle,
so suddenly ceased the story and the joy of
these children. They looked to their mother
for help; she had no hope of a patient
hearing, so she merely said:</p>

<p>&#8220;The children were telling about the
Sunday-school, and&#8221;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sunday-school! yes, they were over
there at Brown&#8217;s, and have had their heads
filled with nonsense&mdash;have they?&#8221;</p>

<p>The mother&#8217;s lips were sealed. The
humility and silence that greeted him only
vexed him the more; so, seeing no opposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
offered, he commenced again on the aggressive.
Addressing his wife in tones of haughty
reproach, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to know whether you and these
little brats are going to side with every whining
loafer that comes about?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then turning to the children, who were
crying, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to know what you are bawling
about? If you don&#8217;t soon shut up you&#8217;ll wish
you had.&#8221;</p>

<p>The children again looked at their mother;
but as she was still silent, George stammered
out, &#8220;We want to go to Sunday-school,
father.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little Mary, with her eyes sparkling in
tears, now ventured with,</p>

<p>&#8220;Do, father, let us go&mdash;won&#8217;t you, father?&#8221;</p>

<p>This was said with such a beseeching
voice and hopeful look, that for the instant
the storm was lulled; and had the mother
joined her children in their petition, perhaps a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
limited privilege might have been obtained for
them. But she failed! The precious moment
went by unimproved, and all was lost!</p>

<p>The father would not listen to what his
better feelings suggested; so he told the
children decidedly that they should not go to
the Sunday-school, and if they did not stop
crying he would punish them severely.
After he left the house, their mother endeavored
to console them; but they felt that
they had been unjustly treated, and wished
to know <i>why</i> they could not go to Sunday-school.
Their mother did not attempt to give
the reason; for she, too, felt that they had
been wronged.</p>

<p>Supper-time came, but the children&#8217;s grief
had taken their appetite, so their mother excused
them from coming to the table. Their
father, finding that they were not coming, and
knowing the reason, whipped them severely
and forced them to come; they sat down and
tried to eat, but every mouthful seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
choke them. The mother&#8217;s eyes were dim
with tears, and the meal was eaten in silence.
The father&#8217;s face was flushed, and he hurried
through his supper, being anxious to get
away from the presence of those whom he
had wronged. When he had gone out, the
mother again tried to soothe the children,
but their father&#8217;s absence only gave them the
liberty to sob aloud; their mother, fearing
that he might return and hear them, bade
them go out to the barn and hunt the eggs,
and be good children.</p>

<p>&#8220;We want to go to Sunday-school and
learn to be good,&#8221; said they. Every word of
this went straight to the heart of the mother.
The children went and did what their mother
had desired; as they staid out longer than
she thought necessary, she became troubled
and started in search of them. Hearing
George&#8217;s voice, she listened and found that
he was praying, and Mary was repeating the
words after him. A consciousness of having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
failed in the performance of her duty filled
her heart with anguish, and she went into the
barn and joined them in prayer; but her
faith was weak&mdash;she feared her husband more
than God. She resolved, however, to make
the attempt to plead in behalf of the children;
going into the house, she found her
husband trying to find something to interest
him in an old newspaper. Her heart
beat between hope and fear; taking a seat she
commenced her petition.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is your head turned too?&#8221; he sneeringly
asked. &#8220;I guess, the next thing I know,
you&#8217;ll have an agency and the pretty loafer
lounging around here. But let him come,&#8221;
he continued; &#8220;just let soap-stick come; I&#8217;ll
kick him out of my house so quick, that he
won&#8217;t know what hurt him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The wife&#8217;s heart was too full for utterance,
so she said nothing. Construing her silence
into contempt, he resumed fiercely.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You&#8217;ve</i> been poking this stuff into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
children&#8217;s heads yourself, have you? I&#8217;ll beat
it out of them, mind you!&#8221; said he, shaking
his fist in the air. The mother&#8217;s resolution
was gone, and she meekly replied, &#8220;No, I
have not said anything.&#8221; She yielded all for
the sake of appeasing her husband. After
berating the missionary and making some
threats about &#8220;this fuss in the family,&#8221; Mr.
Steele went to bed.</p>

<p>Had this father but consented to &#8220;prove
all things,&#8221; as the apostle had recommended,
all of the unhappiness now existing in his
family might have been avoided.</p>

<small><i>GEORGE AND MARY.</i></small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE Sunday-school having been successfully
organized, Mr. Steele was extremely
vexed, and he withdrew himself as far as
possible from those who went with the missionary
in the movement. He was, besides,
ambitious and proud&mdash;he could not bear to
think that &#8220;a traveling loafer,&#8221; as he termed
the missionary, should overcome him; and,
being considered the champion of the opposition,
he mingled with the wicked, courting
their praise, and bringing himself to their
level. He was fighting in vain, for it was
against God.</p>

<p>A few more weeks passed away, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
having been quite a while since George and
Mary had seen their friends, they asked their
mother if they might make Henry and Eliza
a visit; she referred them to their father for
permission. George persuaded Mary to ask,
for he knew that his little sister&#8217;s winning
manner would be more likely to accomplish
the object; watching her opportunity, she
climbed upon her father&#8217;s knee, and putting
her arms around his neck, kissed him; she
had done so before, but not for some time.
The caress pleased him, and he returned the
kiss. Not thinking of anything in particular,
he said, &#8220;Well, what else do you want, my
little pet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t give me what I wanted,
anyhow, would you father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, anything you ask;&#8221; and he
gave her another kiss, adding, &#8220;Well, pet,
what is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;George and I would <i>so</i> much like to go
see Henry and Eliza&mdash;may we?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>For a moment he was in doubt, the nature
of the request being so unexpected; but for
once he allowed his better nature to have
sway, and consented on condition that they
would come home early. They were soon
on their way, as happy as the birds on a
sunny morning.</p>

<p>Henry and Eliza were delighted to see
them, and entertained them by giving a minute
account of all that transpired in the
Sunday-school; they also gave them some of
the cards and papers which they had received
there.</p>

<p>George and Mary kept their promise to
&#8220;come home early.&#8221; Whilst they were
showing their mother the Sunday-school
cards and papers, their father entered the
room. He became very angry upon being thus
reminded of the subject so disagreeable to
him; so, seizing the children&#8217;s gifts, he tore
them into pieces and then threw them out the
window, and declared that the children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
should never go to Mr. Brown&#8217;s again. The
result of such a course on his part, was that
the hearts of his children were hardened
against him; they felt that they had been unkindly
and unjustly treated, and they very
soon became irritable and peevish in disposition.
Their father soon discovered the change,
and knowing the cause, he determined to restore
them to their usual spirits by affording
them amusement; so he induced them to seek
new playmates, among those who did not attend
Sunday-school. They obeyed; but, at
first, such company was exceedingly disagreeable
to them, for the children with
whom they associated were profane and vulgar
and did not regard God&#8217;s Holy day.
They had been taught by their mother that
such conduct was wrong; but the father now
ruled with a rod of iron, and all were compelled
to bend to his will.</p>

<p>The downward course is rapid; it was but
a few short years before George and Mary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
surrounded by such influence, could mock
with the mocker, at the prayer-meeting and
Sunday-school.</p>

<p>The father, annoyed by the success of the
good cause, and a consciousness of wrong-doing,
sought relief in drink&mdash;hence he was
thrown into the society of the worthless, vulgar
drunkards, who lie around the haunts of
vice. Insensibly, he was drifting down to irretrievable
ruin!</p>

<p>He never expected to be a drunkard&mdash;not
he! No, he could drink when he pleased,
and let it alone when he pleased. He
would show &#8220;that crazy Truman,&#8221; that
a man could <i>govern</i> his appetite, and that he
did not speak the truth when he said that
confirmed whisky-drinkers would fill drunkards&#8217;
graves.</p>

<p>He found out to his own sorrow who spoke
the truth; for the time came when he was compelled
to give up his comfortable home to
satisfy the tavern-keeper&#8217;s demands. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
wife, through disappointment and abuse, lost
her health and died broken-hearted, before
her husband and children had run their whole
course of sin.</p>

<small><i>MR. BROWN&#8217;S FAMILY&mdash;MR. STEELE.</i></small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">WHILST the Steele family was descending
deeper and deeper into sin and
degradation, the family of Mr. Brown was
advancing in virtue, honor and holiness.
Henry and Eliza were faithful members of
Christ&#8217;s visible Church&mdash;they had been taught
to love the Saviour in the Sunday-school;
they were now teachers in the same, and by
their love and practical instructions, their
humble piety and fervent prayers, they led
more than one to the Fountain of Life.</p>

<p>Henry, like his father, was a noble-looking
man, of very prepossessing appearance. His
taste for the beautiful and true increased with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
his years, and his knowledge of many subjects
became extensive and thorough&mdash;thus
was he fitted for almost any position of honor
and trust.</p>

<p>Eliza&#8217;s naturally amiable disposition was
developed to advantage under Christian influence,
and she married a man whose high
moral and religious excellence made him
eminently worthy of her. Living in anticipation
of joys to come, she could not help
being happy.</p>

<p>Passing over a few more years, we will
look, for a time, at the little Mary of other
days. In a forlorn old hut, far away from
any other house, we find her crouched upon
the floor, shivering with the cold, and in
almost a starving condition; her father had
left her some weeks previous, under the pretence
that he was going in search of work;
her brother had long since gone from the
place, with little or no purpose in view; she
knew nothing of his whereabouts, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
seemed to her that she was now utterly forsaken,
for she had received no word from
her father during his absence. She wished
that she might die&mdash;not thinking or caring
what the consequence would be. As she sat
thus, musing over her sad lot, Providence
seemed to direct the steps of Mr. Brown,
whose business called him to that part of the
country, to the old hut; his heart was
touched at the sight of her sufferings, and it
was not long before he made arrangements
for her removal to his own house; and he
and his wife exerted themselves to win this
wandering child to the straight and narrow
path. Although it took a long time for her
to break up her old habits, she at length
became a follower of the meek and lowly
Jesus. Mr. and Mrs. Brown were father and
mother to her, and she endeavored in every
possible way to show her gratitude for kindness
so freely bestowed.</p>

<p>Time passed on, and Mary, not hearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
anything of her father, grieved for him as
dead; although she never knew to any
certainty that such was the case.</p>

<p>On a clear, cold morning, about a year
after Mr. Steele had left his daughter, as a
party of hunters were crossing a prairie
many miles distant from Clear Creek Settlement,
they found the body of a man who
had evidently been frozen to death. Any
one could see at a glance that he had been a
drinking character, and most probably under
the influence of liquor at the time of his
death. The hunters took the body to the
nearest settlement, and made inquiry as to
who it might be; none knew excepting a
grocer, who came forward and stated that
this man had chopped wood for him on the
day previous, and, according to his own
request, took his pay in whisky; after this
no one remembered having seen him, but it
was supposed by those present at this time,
that he had become intoxicated, and after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
wandering on for some time, had fallen down
in a drunken stupor, from which he never
awoke in this world. Whether or not the
grocer, who had been an actor in this tragedy,
had any compunctions of conscience at this
time, we are unable to say; he interested
himself, however, in procuring a rough box
in which the remains of Mr. Steele (for it was
he), were placed, and buried by those who
never had known him in life. Thus ended
the career of one who depended upon his
own strength to resist temptation, and set
himself up in opposition to the means employed
for the furtherance of God&#8217;s cause.
This may be an extreme case, but it is not
the first instance in which God has visited
retribution in this world.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII.<br />

<small><i>THE MISSIONARY AGAIN VISITS THE WEST.</i></small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IN that beautiful season of the year in which
the missionary first visited the West, he
was again on his way thither, but not with
his pilgrim-staff&mdash;that was now laid aside.
He could no longer travel hundreds of miles
on foot as he once did&mdash;he was now in a
carriage with the venerable Mr. Mason.</p>

<p>He had written to his people in the West,
promising to visit them if they would send a
conveyance for him, as he was no longer able
to walk, and was too poor to go by stage.
Yes, he was poor in this world&#8217;s goods, but
rich in Christ&mdash;an heir of Heaven!</p>

<p>No sooner was his letter received, than it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
was read in the churches and Sunday-schools,
and a liberal collection was soon
taken up, to insure every convenience necessary
for his accommodation; and Mr. Mason
volunteered to bring him out. The journey
proved to be a great advantage to his failing
health.</p>

<p>The appearance of things was very much
changed to him, for eighteen years had
elapsed since he first came to this place.
The little ones had grown up, the youth
were heads of families, and the locks of the
older persons were turning gray, and many
had gone the way of all the earth. Many
new settlers had come in, the little hut villages
had become towns, the trails and wood-paths
were now highways and stage-routes,
the log school-houses had become substantial
frame churches, and the wilderness in which
the missionary had suffered was now being
settled and covered with new farms. His
friends in the cause of Christ, Mr. Brown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
and Mr. Wilson and Mr. Truman, the defender
of Temperance, were still alive, &#8220;Steadfast
and unmovable, always abounding in the
work of the Lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many blessed seasons he enjoyed with
them, and they were often &#8220;sitting in
heavenly places in Christ Jesus.&#8221; After a
rest of some days, the missionary felt able
to preach and lecture among the people.
The opposition to Sunday-schools and the
cause of Temperance had in a great measure
subsided; public opinion, that great leveler of
uprisings, had taken sides with the &#8220;new
measures,&#8221; for the very elements of the
Western character demand progress and life.
The missionary&#8217;s preaching was especially
blest to the Sunday-schools; through his efforts
whole classes, with their teachers, were
brought into the Church.</p>

<p>During one of these gracious seasons,
when many were turning to the Lord, a
dreadful murder was committed at one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
groceries in the village. One of the Sunday-school
teachers, and a noted advocate of Temperance,
heard that one of his class had been
persuaded to accompany a man to a grocery.
The teacher resolved to save his scholar from
the influence of the fiends who were aiming
at his destruction; he succeeded in getting
the boy to leave the place. They had taken
but a few steps, when some one rushed up
behind the young man, and stabbed him in
the back under the shoulder blade, piercing
his heart. The knife did its work effectually,
for he expired in almost a moment&#8217;s time.</p>

<p>The excitement following this event was
intense. There were several persons present,
who held the murdered young man in high
esteem; these arrested the murderer and held
him secure. In the meantime, the news of
the atrocious deed spread all over the country,
and hundreds gathered to the scene of
blood. Had it not been for the high state of
religious interest prevailing, lynch law would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
have been executed upon the heartless criminal,
by hanging him to the nearest tree; but
an officer was allowed to lead him away to a
place of confinement.</p>

<p>The young man&#8217;s body was conveyed to
his father&#8217;s house amid weeping and lamentations.
This was too much for some of the
people; and, as if actuated by a sense of justice,
they went back and demolished the den
as a common nuisance. All the liquors were
destroyed and the owners prosecuted. This
was summary work; but the general temperament
of the Western people is such, that
they not unfrequently take the law into their
own hands, when they fear that justice will
be tardy or uncertain from the courts.</p>

<p>On the day appointed for the funeral of
the young man, hundreds were early at the
house of the dead. The Temperance Societies
were all present in mourning. Many
who, through his instrumentality, had been led
to Christ were there, and shed tears of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
genuine grief over his remains; aged Christians
groaned in their sorrow. Indeed, there
was scarcely one present who was not moved
to tears.</p>

<p>The missionary preached the funeral sermon
from John xi, 25:&mdash;&#8220;I am the resurrection
and the life; he that believeth in me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live.&#8221; He
alluded to the consolation afforded in the
sentence referring to eternal life. He exhorted
all to prepare for death, and dealt
the rumsellers a blow, which, connected with
the circumstances that brought them
together, led them to think, at least, of what
they were doing. He concluded with a reference
to the exemplary Christian character of
the deceased, and exhorted all to follow him,
as far as he had followed Christ.</p>

<p>Several other ministers were present, who
also delivered short addresses of a very impressive
character. These were followed by
Mr. Truman, who made one of the most eloquent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
and masterly appeals in behalf of the
Temperance cause ever made in that country.
An aged minister then led in prayer, after
which the painful exercises were closed.</p>

<small><i>DEATH.</i></small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE murderer had been taken to the
county jail to await his trial. In the meantime,
suspicion was aroused that the prisoner
was George Steele, but he steadily denied it,
and insisted that he was John Pogue. The
rumor coming to Mary&#8217;s ears, she at once
feared that it might be true; and to relieve
her mind of the dreadful suspense, she resolved
to know the worst, and hence obtained
permission to enter his cell. When
the door was opened, there, in chains, sat
George! Although she had felt that it
would be so, she was nevertheless shocked
at the sight before her. He tried to evade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the recognition, but his heart failed; ungovernable
emotions unmanned him, and he
wept like a child.</p>

<p>&#8220;George, my brother, my dear brother,
how could you do that thing?&#8221; she exclaimed,
and her whole frame shook as she
spoke. After a while she became more calm
and asked the keeper to allow her to be
alone with her brother for a short time; he
consented, and she sat down on the bed,
close beside her brother, as she did years
ago, when they played under the elm-tree at
their dear old home. He told her all&mdash;&#8220;But,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;I was in liquor, and a fiend seemed
to drive me to the awful deed! I was not to
blame so much; I did not use to be so, did I,
Mary?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, George,&#8221; she gently replied, &#8220;you
were once a good boy;&#8221; and then, after
hesitating a moment, she said, &#8220;do you pray
now, brother?&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her in a dreamy way, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
said, &#8220;<i>I</i> pray! I cannot pray!&#8221; then his eye
kindled, and he continued, &#8220;<i>I</i> am not to
blame; when you and I wanted to be good
father would not let us, but taught us that
Sabbath-breaking, swearing, dancing and
drinking were only amusements that everybody
should enjoy; and we soon learned to
like these things, Mary&mdash;and where am I
now?&#8221; She leaned her head upon her hands
and sighed; then rousing herself, said hopefully,
&#8220;It is not too late yet, George; God
has been merciful to me, and has pardoned
all my sins; if you repent as I did, He will
not cast you off; but you must pray, George,
with all your heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>Looking into her eyes, he replied by saying,
&#8220;<i>You</i> pray for me, Mary.&#8221; Kneeling
down, she brought her poor, sinful brother&#8217;s
case before the Mercy-seat; but there was
no godly sorrow for sin in his heart&mdash;the fear
of death made him wish for prayers. Had
he been at liberty, he would have been as bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
as ever; and no wonder pardon was not
granted. After Mary rose from her knees,
she had some further conversation with her
brother, and then took leave of him with a
heavy heart. This was their last meeting.
The time for George&#8217;s trial arrived; the
court-room was crowded with curious and
idle spectators; the prisoner was brought
forward to answer the charge of murder; he
pleaded &#8220;Not guilty.&#8221; A plea of insanity
was set up by his counsel, and an artful
defense made for him; but the case was
clear, and the testimony against him overwhelming.</p>

<p>The Judge of the district was Henry
Brown. The prisoner was directed to stand
up; the Judge asked him if he had anything
further to say, why sentence of death should
not be pronounced; he shook his head and
faltered, &#8220;<i>No</i>.&#8221; After receiving his sentence,
he desired to see the Judge. They met.
Neither could speak&mdash;a convulsive pressure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
of hands was all that passed between them.</p>

<p>What a contrast is here! Both men occupied
the same social position in childhood;
yet a difference in training and associations
brought about the present result. May God
help us to take warning!</p>

<p>Thirty days were given the prisoner to prepare
for the eternal future. His jailer was
kind to him, and offered to get him any
religious advice he desired; at first he
refused to see any one, but as the time of
death drew nearer, he consented; the missionary
to whom he had given a cup of water
in his boyhood was ready and anxious to go
to him; and no sooner had he received
George&#8217;s permission, than he was at his side,
endeavoring to shed light upon his darkened
understanding; but the good man&#8217;s prayers
and advice seemed to produce little or no
impression upon the mind and heart of George.
He felt that there was no hope for him, and
as the missionary left him he requested him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
to preach his funeral sermon, and in doing
so, warn others not to follow the example of
one whose earthly career was short, and
ended in death and everlasting misery.</p>

<p>We will now draw a veil over the closing
scene in the life of this young man. In doing
so, we would say to the Sunday-school scholar,
bear in mind your great privileges&mdash;do not
abuse them&mdash;do not consider it a task, but a
pleasure, to prepare the lessons given you&mdash;keep
ever before your mind the fact, that it
is your soul&#8217;s eternal interest, and God&#8217;s
glory, for which you must work.</p>

<p>The missionary lived several years after
his return to his Eastern home; and, like Paul,
he would frequently write an epistle to his
brethren in the West&mdash;thus could their hearts
still commune with each other. But the
time came when this laborer in the Master&#8217;s
vineyard was called to rest. The close of
his life was as calm as the summer evening
upon which he was called. With the apostle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
he could say, &#8220;I have fought a good fight, I
have finished my course, I have kept the
faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me a
crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the
righteous Judge, shall give at that day&mdash;and
not to me only, but unto all them that love
His appearing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Compare the death of the earnest, working
Christian, with that of the opposer of truth
or of the cold-hearted formalist. After death
comes the judgment!&mdash;and the Saviour has
said, that the former shall live and reign with
Him, whilst the latter shall go away into
everlasting punishment.</p>

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
